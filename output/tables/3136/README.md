# Higher education R&D expenditures, ranked by all R&D expenditures, by R&D field: FY 2019

**Modal ID:** 3136

**Table Number:** 22

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Tied institutions are ranked alphabetically. Ranked institutions are geographically separate campuses headed by a campus-level president or chancellor. Some campuses are part of large, multi-campus universities; some are part of state university systems. For a complete list of campuses that belong to a larger university or system and their aggregate R&D expenditures, see table 6. This table includes only institutions reporting $1 million or more in total R&D expenditures in 2018. Institutions reporting less than $1 million in total R&D expenditures in 2018 completed a shorter version of the survey form in FY 2019, and that form did not collect R&D expenditures by source and detailed field. For R&D expenditures by major field at institutions completing the shorter version of the survey, see table 82.
