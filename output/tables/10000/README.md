**Modal ID:** 10000

**Table Number:** SPBS-32

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Percent)

## Notes

Articles refer to publications from a selection of conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journal articles in S&E fields from Scopus. Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a region, country, or economy on the basis of the institutional address(es) of the author(s) listed in the article. Articles are credited on a fractional count basis (i.e., for articles from multiple countries, each country receives fractional credit on the basis of the proportion of its participating authors). Percentages may not add to 100% because of rounding. Data are not directly comparable with those in Science and Engineering Indicators 2022; see Technical Appendix section on data filters. Cell shading is darker blue for the scientific fields where a region, country, or economy has the largest percentage, and darker orange denotes the smallest percentage for that region, country, or economy. See Table SPBS-2 through Table SPBS-16 for source data.
