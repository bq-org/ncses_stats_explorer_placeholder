# Incidence of various types of innovation by cloud adopters and non-adopters for single-unit firms, by settlement size category

**Modal ID:** 7226

**Table Number:** 6

**Type:** CH (Column Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Percent, ratio, and standard error)

## Notes

Settlement size categories are the RUCCs constructed by the Economic Research Service using official Office of Management and Budget designations of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes.aspx). More information on the rural-urban continuum codes available here: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes.aspx. These estimates are derived from companies with only a single location and may differ from the published innovation counts and estimates based on single- and multi-unit firms (Kindlon 2021). Limiting analysis to single-unit firms eliminates the potential headquarters' bias resulting from attributing innovation to the reporting location of multi-unit firms and reduces potential measurement error resulting from attributing company reports of innovation to all branch locations. The statistics allow inferences regarding the population of single-unit firms but do not allow inferences regarding the population of all firms.
