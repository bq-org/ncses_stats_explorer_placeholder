**Modal ID:** 4414

**Table Number:** SLBR-7

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Percent)

## Notes

Scientists and engineers include those with one or more S&E or S&E-related degrees at the bachelor's level or higher or those who have only a non-S&E degree at the bachelor's level or higher and are employed in an S&E or S&E-related occupation. For data on unemployment rates by occupation, calculations assume that unemployed individuals are seeking further employment in their most recent occupation. Non-S&E occupations include middle-skill and non-STEM occupations.
