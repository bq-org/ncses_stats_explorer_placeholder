# U.S. applied research expenditures, by performing sector and source of funds: 1953&#8211;2022

**Modal ID:** 10476

**Table Number:** 4

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Millions of current and of constant 2017 dollars)

## Notes

For detail on type-of-R&D data, see table 3, footnotes b–f. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Constant-dollar estimates are derived from unrounded data. For trend comparisons, use only the historical data reported in this table because some back-year data may have been revised. Data are based on reports by performers in the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics annual surveys on R&D expenditures: Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey, Annual Business Survey, Higher Education Research and Development Survey, Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development, FFRDC Research and Development Survey, and Survey of State Government Research and Development. R&D expenditures by business performers—and, before 2001, also industry-administered FFRDCs—were collected on a calendar year basis. Expenditures for other performers are calendar year approximations based on fiscal year data. For federal performers in 1977 and afterward, the approximation equals 75% of the amount reported in the same fiscal year plus 25% of the amount reported in the subsequent fiscal year. Prior to 1977, the federal fiscal year began on 1 July, not 1 October, and the approximation is 50% of the amount reported in the same fiscal year plus 50% of the amount reported in the subsequent fiscal year. The fiscal year for higher education performers and state government performers generally begins 1 July, and the calendar year approximation is 50% of the amount reported in the same fiscal year plus 50% of amount reported in the subsequent fiscal year.
