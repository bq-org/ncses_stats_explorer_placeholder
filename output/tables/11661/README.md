# Baccalaureate-origin institution characteristics of research doctorate recipients, by broad field of doctorate: 2023

**Modal ID:** 11661

**Table Number:** 5-4

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Tied countries or economies are listed alphabetically. Carnegie classification is based on the 2021 Carnegie Classifications: Doctoral universities - very high research (R1), Doctoral universities - high research (R2), Doctoral/ professional universities, and other universities, which includes all other Carnegie classifications (e.g., special focus institutions) and institutions without Carnegie classifications. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and new broad, major, and detailed fields are used in tables reporting data from 2021 to the present; see the field list in table A-4. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information about the 2021 taxonomy change, see the "Technical Notes."
