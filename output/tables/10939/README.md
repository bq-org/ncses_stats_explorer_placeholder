# U.S. business R&D performance, by source of funds: 2021

**Modal ID:** 10939

**Table Number:** RD-7

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Millions of dollars)

## Notes

Data are for companies with 10 or more domestic employees. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Beginning in survey year 2018, companies that performed or funded less than $50,000 of R&D were excluded from tabulation. These companies in aggregate represented a very small share of total R&D expenditures in prior years. Had the companies under this threshold been included in the 2018 estimates, they would have contributed approximately $90 million to overall R&D expenditures. Industry classification was based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Excludes data for federally funded research and development centers.
