# Imputed amounts for higher education R&D expenditures in clinical trials, by source of funds: FY 2021

**Modal ID:** 7931

**Table Number:** A-11

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Imputation rate at total level is lower than imputation rates at detail levels because some institutions could provide totals but not details. This table includes only institutions reporting $1 million or more in total R&D expenditures in FY 2020. Institutions reporting less than $1 million in total R&D expenditures in FY 2020 completed a shorter version of the survey form in FY 2021 that did not include this question.
