  "notes": "For each broad field of doctorate, data are presented for the source countries with the largest numbers of U.S. doctorate recipients in that field in 2014\u201317. Data include foreign doctorate recipients who are on permanent or temporary visas and also those whose visa status is unknown. The information on a plan to stay or a definite plan to stay reflects intentions within the year after graduation as reported by the doctoral recipient around the graduation date. Recipients who plan to stay think they will locate in the United States; those with definite plans have a postdoctoral research appointment or a definite employment plan in the United States. Percentages are based on the total number of foreign S&E doctorate recipients, including those who did not report their postgraduate location plans or employment plans. The percentage of foreign S&E doctorate recipients who did not report postgraduate location plans ranged from 2.1% to 4.5% over the 2006\u201317 period, and the percentage who either did not report postgraduate location plans or did not report employment plans ranged from 3.3% to 7.0% over that period.",
