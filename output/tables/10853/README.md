Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Geographic distribution of DOD development funding to businesses reflects location of prime contractors and not the numerous subcontractors who perform much of the R&D. FY 2022 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act).
