  "notes": "Technology focus categories may not sum to the total because companies may report their R&D costs in zero, one, or many categories. Industry and company size category detail may not add to total because of rounding. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. Industry classification was based on dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Technologies are not mutually exclusive as companies could report R&D in one, more than one, or no technology focus. Additional industry-level data can be found in the full set of BRDS detailed statistical tables posted online.",
