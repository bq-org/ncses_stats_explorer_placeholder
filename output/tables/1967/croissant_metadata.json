  "notes": "Output of KTI industries is on a value-added basis. Value added is the amount contributed by a country, firm, or other entity to the value of a good or service and excludes purchases of domestic and imported materials and inputs. KTI industries include high R&D intensive and medium-high R&D intensive industries based on a classification by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Data for the software publishing are not available; data on the larger publishing industry, which includes software publishing, is used as a proxy for this industry. Data are not available for medical and dental instruments. World total does not include all countries and economies due to limitations in data availability. See Table S6-2 through Table S6-16.",
