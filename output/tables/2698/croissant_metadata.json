  "notes": "Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. This change has affected the comparability of these estimates with estimates published for years prior to 2018. Statistics are based on companies in the United States that reported to the survey. No systematic item imputation was applied.\u00a0Beginning in survey year 2018, these statistics include an adjustment to the weight to account for unit nonresponse. A company having multiple reporting parts for data collection may contribute to the statistics for multiple industries, so the detail may not add to the total for the number of companies.",
