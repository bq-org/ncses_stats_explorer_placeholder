FFRDC funding over the years may be affected by the creation of new FFRDCs and the phasing out of other FFRDCs as well as changes in the type of FFRDC administrator. For details, see the notes in the Master Government List of Federally Funded R&D Centers at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/#ffrdc. FYs 2009 and 2010 obligations include additional funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. FY 2020 preliminary data do not include obligations from supplemental COVID-19 related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act).",
