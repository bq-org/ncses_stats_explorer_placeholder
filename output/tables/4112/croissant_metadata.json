  "notes": "Lower secondary education in the United States includes grades 7\u20139. Mathematics and science teachers are identified through teacher reports of the subject taught in their target class, which is defined as the first class that teachers taught in their school after 11 a.m. Tuesday in the week before the interview. If a teacher did not teach on Tuesday, the target class can be a class taught on a day following the last Tuesday. Teachers whose target class consisted of entirely or mainly special needs students were not asked about the subject taught in their target class and therefore excluded in the table. Teachers' education is based on the 2011 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), which defines nine education levels: level 0 = early childhood education, level 1 = primary education, level 2 = lower secondary education, level 3 = upper secondary education, level 4 = postsecondary non-tertiary education, level 5 = short-cycle tertiary education, level 6 = bachelor's degree or equivalent education, level 7 = master's degree or equivalent education, and level 8 = doctoral degree or equivalent education. More information about ISCED 2011 is available at http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf. The table does not include teachers from Belgium-Flemish and Iceland because the Belgium-Flemish data do not meet international technical standards, and Iceland does not permit secondary data analyses unless the data files are obtained directly from the country. Percentages may not add to 100% because of rounding.",
