## Notes

Data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) cover employed persons 16 years and older. Annual estimates are based on CPS monthly data. In 2011, the CPS taxonomy for occupations was revised; therefore, data from 2011 and afterward may not be comparable to data for previous years. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. This table will not match previously published tables exactly due to source change and an error correction.
