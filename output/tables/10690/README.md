# Distribution of graduate students, postdoctoral appointees, and doctorate-holding nonfaculty researchers across science, engineering, and health fields: 2022

**Modal ID:** 10690

**Table Number:** 4-1

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

For postdoctoral appointees and doctorate-holding nonfaculty researchers, "field" refers to the field of the unit that reports information on these groups to the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS). Percentages may not add to total because of rounding. For more information on the mapping of GSS fields and codes, see technical table A-17. Graduate student data in this table include master's students in health sciences. For more information on the comparability of these counts to other data published by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, see the "Technical Notes."
