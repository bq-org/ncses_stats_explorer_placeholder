**Modal ID:** 10576

**Table Number:** SINV-29

**Type:** ST (Simple Tabular)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Included repositories are those with an Open Source Initiative–approved open-source license; software shared through other licenses are excluded. Public higher education institutions and selected private entities are included as benchmarks. Overall in terms of number of repositories contributed to, Microsoft and RedHat are the two largest contributors from the private sector and University of California, Berkeley, is the largest contributor from higher education institutions. The highest contributor to open-source software is the Department of Energy (DOE), which encompasses 17 national laboratories, 16 of which were included in the data. The exception is DOE's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, formerly known as Stanford Linear Accelerator. Due to data constraints, these repositories are attributed to the operator rather than to DOE.
