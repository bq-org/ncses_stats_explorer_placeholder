Advanced economies are based on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) designation of advanced economies (Table A, pg. 132 in World Economic Outlook: Challenges to Steady Growth, 2018). IMF does not classify Russia as an advanced economy, but it is included in this analysis because it is a large economy with high levels of student achievement.",
