For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D and are not comparable with estimates published for years prior to 2018. R&D program size classifications are based on R&D performance. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.",
