Coding of occupations into STEM categories reflects changes to American Community Survey (ACS) occupation codes following the 2018 update to the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) implemented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Data from 2011 and 2016 use occupations from the 2010 occupation list, while data from 2021 use occupations from the 2018 occupation list. Total number of workers in each year were 137,527,445 in 2011; 149,016,499 in 2016; and 152,367,575 in 2021.",
