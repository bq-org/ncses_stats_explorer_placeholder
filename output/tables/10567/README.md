## Notes

Patents are allocated according to patent ownership information. Data include institutions affiliated with academic institutions, such as university and alumni organizations, foundations, university associations, and affiliated hospitals. Universities vary in how patents are assigned (e.g., to boards of regents, individual campuses, or entities with or without affiliation with the university). Patents are classified under the WIPO classification of patents, which classifies International Patent Classification (IPC) codes under 35 technical fields. IPC reformed codes take into account changes that were made to the WIPO classification in 2006 under the eighth version of the classification and were used to prepare these data. However, because PatentsView only provides the original IPC codes as they appeared on patents and not the IPC reformed codes, current Cooperative Patent Classification codes on patents were converted back to the most recent IPC classification to prepare these statistics. Fractional counts of patents were assigned to each technological field on patents to assign the proper weight of a patent to the corresponding technological fields under the classification. For instance, a patent that is classified under five different technological fields will see each of its technological fields receive a 0.2 count of the patent, so that the patent accounts for a count of 1.0 across all technological fields. Patents were also fractionally allocated among regions, countries, or economies based on the proportion of residences of all assignees. As such, data across technical fields sum to the total number of granted academic patents in the United States. Data across technical fields also sum to the total number of patents granted by USPTO. The United States includes Puerto Rico and all other U.S. territories.
