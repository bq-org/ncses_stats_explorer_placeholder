  "notes": "Companies were sent the detailed survey form (BRDI-1) if their R&D spending was at least $1.0 million in 2014 or 2015 (except companies that did not respond in these prior 2 years). All other companies received an abbreviated form (BRDI-1(S)). Companies were said to be known to conduct R&D (known positive R&D) if they reported positive R&D in any of the previous 5 survey years. Companies were said to have known zero R&D if they reported zero R&D in at least 1 of the previous 3 survey years and no positive R&D in any of the 5 years. Companies were said to be unknown if no R&D information was available.",
