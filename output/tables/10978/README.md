## Notes

Regions, countries, or economies without 2021 data have the most recent data year shown in parentheses next to their name. Data for U.S. GERD differ slightly from the U.S. total R&D data tabulated elsewhere in this report. For better consistency with international standards, U.S. GERD includes federal capital funding for federal intramural and nonprofit R&D, in addition to what is reported as U.S. total R&D. Some data are preliminary and may be revised later. Foreign currencies are converted by OECD to U.S. dollars using PPP.
