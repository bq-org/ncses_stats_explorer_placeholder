  "notes": "Regions, countries, or economies without 2021 data have the most recent data year shown in parentheses next to their name. Data for U.S. GERD differ slightly from the U.S. total R&D data tabulated elsewhere in this report. For better consistency with international standards, U.S. GERD includes federal capital funding for federal intramural and nonprofit R&D, in addition to what is reported as U.S. total R&D. Some data are preliminary and may be revised later. Foreign currencies are converted by OECD to U.S. dollars using PPP.",
