  "notes": "Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and new broad, major, and detailed fields are used in tables reporting data from 2021 to the present; see the field list in table A-4. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information, see the \"Technical Notes\" and the SED 2021 Taxonomy Changes Working Paper (available at https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses23200). Between 2021 and 2022, minor changes were made to the SED-CIP crosswalk for the SED detailed fields to better align with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics' Taxonomy of Disciplines. These changes affect the reported counts for 2021; see table A-5 for more information.",
