For the FY 2020 survey, the Department of Defense (DOD) S&E support to higher education institutions and DOD R&D support to nonprofit organizations are known to be understated. However, the magnitude of the missing data is unknown. Data users should use caution when conducting any time series analysis that includes DOD obligations data for FY 2020.",
