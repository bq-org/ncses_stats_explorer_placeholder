# Federal funding for R&D plus capital R&D, by GBARD socioeconomic objectives: FYs 2000–24

**Modal ID:** 10451

**Table Number:** 26

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Millions of dollars)

## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. The data in this table reflect an estimated adjustment to the previously published 2000–16 time series totals (in table 23 through table 25) applying the narrowed definition of development described by the Office of Management and Budget in its Circular A-11 of July 2016. The 14 socioeconomic objectives categories listed are those identified by the European Union in the 2007 edition of its Nomenclature for the Analysis and Comparison of Scientific Programmes and Budgets (NABS). The NABS categories are the basis of the GBARD indicators that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reports for member countries and selected others in its twice-yearly Main Science and Technology Indicators reports. U.S. data for objectives 9, 10, and 11 are not reported for 2000–06 because the NABS category revisions of 2007 and equivalent data for these earlier years were not available. The lack of availability of details for these objectives is the main reason that the sum of the reported details for 2000–06 do not add to the "R&D plus capital R&D" totals.
