# Decomposition of patenting rates for commuting zones based on level of urbanization

**Modal ID:** 5975

**Table Number:** 6b

**Type:** CH (Column Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Rate and composition factors pertaining to patenting)

## Notes

RF is patents per inventive class member, and CF is inventive class as a share of total commuting zone population. In a departure from Wojan, Dotzel, and Low (2015), all Hawaiian and Alaskan commuting zones (including Aleutians West Census Area, AK, part of the Seattle, WA, commuting zone) are omitted. This change results in slight discrepancies in observed patenting rates across studies.
