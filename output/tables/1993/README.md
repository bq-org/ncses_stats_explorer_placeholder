## Notes

High R&D intensive products include aircraft; pharmaceuticals; and computer, electronic, and optical products classified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Detail may not add to total because of rounding or minor discrepancies. World exports do not equal imports because of statistical errors in the reporting of trade data and the lack of trade data on sub-Sahara African countries. World total does not include all countries and economies due to limitations in data availability. China includes Hong Kong. China data exclude bilateral flows between mainland China and Hong Kong. See Table S6-17 for a full list of countries and economies in each region.
