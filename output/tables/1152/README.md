# Bachelor's degrees awarded by all institutions and by HHE institutions to Hispanic U.S. citizens and permanent residents, by field: 2006&#8211;16

**Modal ID:** 1152

**Table Number:** 5-9

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

HHE institutions are defined by the U.S. Department of Education as nonprofit public and private institutions of higher education whose full-time equivalent enrollment of undergraduate students is at least 25% Hispanic, according to data that institutions reported in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Fall 2016 Enrollment Survey, conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. Because HHE institutions were identified using the 2016 Enrollment Survey data for all years, these estimates are not comparable to previous years’ tables. Data are based on degree-granting institutions eligible to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs and do not match previously published data that were based on accredited higher education institutions.
