Because HHE institutions were identified using the 2016 Enrollment Survey data for all years, these estimates are not comparable to previous years\u2019 tables. Data are based on degree-granting institutions eligible to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs and do not match previously published data that were based on accredited higher education institutions.",
