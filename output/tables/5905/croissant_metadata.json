China includes Hong Kong. Trademarks are classified under the 11th edition of the Nice classification of goods and services, which classifies trademarks under 34 categories of goods and 11 categories of services. Fractional counts of trademarks were assigned to each category to assign the proper weight of a trademark to the corresponding category under the classification. These counts are then grouped under 10 industry sectors following a mapping defined by Edital.",
