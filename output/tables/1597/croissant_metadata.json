  "notes": "Industries are defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The OES Survey does not cover employment among self-employed workers and employment in private households (NAICS 814). In the employment total for agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting, only the following industries are included: logging (NAICS 1133), support activities for crop production (NAICS 1151), and support activities for animal production (NAICS 1152). As a result, the data do not represent total U.S. employment. Differences between any two industry groups may not be statistically significant. Detail may not add to total because of rounding.",
