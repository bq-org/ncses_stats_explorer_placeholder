# Academic institutions with science and engineering research space shared with other fields or used for purposes other than research, by field: FY 2021

**Modal ID:** 7846

**Table Number:** 6

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Institutions were asked to indicate whether any of the net assignable square feet of research space reported in individual field totals was shared with other fields or used for purposes other than research. Percentages are based on the number of institutions with research space in each field of science and engineering. One institution did not respond to the item asking about shared space with other fields for the field of "Other"; therefore, the percentage for that item is based on 157 institutions, while the percentage reporting on research space used for nonresearch purposes is based on 158 institutions.
