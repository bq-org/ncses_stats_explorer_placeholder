Institutions reporting less than $1 million in total R&D expenditures in FY 2021 completed a shorter version of the survey form in FY 2022 that did not include the question on specific agency funding sources. Total expenditures from institutions reporting less than $1 million in R&D in FY 2022 was $162 million.",
