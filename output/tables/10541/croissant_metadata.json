The scientist tells the participants to put 10 drops in their infected ear each day. After 2 weeks, all participants'\u00a0ear infections had healed. Which of the following changes to the design of this study would most improve the ability to test if the new medication effectively treats ear infections? Create a second group of participants with ear infections who do not use any ear drops. Create a second group of participants with ear infections who use 15 drops a day. Have participants use ear drops for only 1 week. Have participants put ear drops in both their infected ear and healthy ear. Not sure.The time a computer takes to start has increased dramatically. One possible explanation for this is that the computer is running out of memory. This explanation is a scientific\u2026 Hypothesis. Conclusion. Experiment. Observation. Not sure.",
