## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Country detail was not collected from companies reporting less than $1 million of R&D paid for by the company or reporting less than $1 million of R&D paid for by others. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D and are not comparable with estimates published for years prior to 2018.
