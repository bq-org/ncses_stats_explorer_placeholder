## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded R&D. For a given estimate in this table, if the conditions are satisfied for both the i and e flags, the e flag is assigned because the imputation rate may be found in the corresponding table of imputation rates. Changes in data collection and imputation processes have affected the comparability of company count estimates in this table with estimates published for previous years.
