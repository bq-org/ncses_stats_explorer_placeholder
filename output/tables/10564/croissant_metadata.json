  "notes": "Granted patents for all patent authorities are allocated according to patent inventorship information. AI patents are identified and divided into categories using filters consisting of Cooperative Patent Classifications and International Patent Classifications plus keywords and phrases. Details of these filters can be found at https://github.com/georgetown-cset/1790-ai-patent-data/. Only the first granted patent in each patent family is counted so as to avoid double counting the same invention. Patent families containing no granted patents are excluded. Country assignments are based on fractional counting of inventor locations as listed in the associated record from the Global Patent Index. If no inventor countries are listed, the priority country is used (i.e., where the first application in the patent family was filed). China includes Hong Kong. The world total is the sum of individual countries. There is no row duplication.",
