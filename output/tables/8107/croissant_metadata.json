  "notes": "This table reaggregates the R&D performer data in table 3 according to major categories of R&D funding: federal government, nonfederal government (state and local), business, higher education, and NPOs. Business sources of R&D funding in this table include the own funds of domestic R&D-performing businesses, funds from other domestic businesses, and funds from foreign businesses. For further detail on the R&D performers listed, see table 2, footnotes a\u2013f. For detail on type-of-R&D data, see table 3, footnotes b\u2013f. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Constant-dollar estimates are derived from unrounded data. For trend comparisons, use only the historical data reported in this table because some back-year data may have been revised. Data are based on reports by performers in the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics annual surveys on R&D expenditures: Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey, Annual Business Survey, Higher Education Research and Development Survey, Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development, FFRDC Research and Development Survey, and Survey of State Government Research and Development. R&D expenditures by business performers\u2014and, before 2001, also industry-administered FFRDCs\u2014were collected on a calendar year basis. Expenditures for other performers are calendar year approximations based on fiscal year data. (See also table 3, general notes.)",
