  "notes": "Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. FFRDC funding over the years may be affected by the creation of new FFRDCs and the phasing out of other FFRDCs. For details, see the notes in the Master Government List of Federally Funded R&D Centers at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/#ffrdc. FYs 2009 and 2010 obligations include additional funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Beginning with FY 2016, the totals reported for development obligations represent a refinement to this category by more narrowly defining it to be \"experimental development.\" Most notably, totals for development do not include the Department of Defense (DOD) Budget Activity 7 (Operational Systems Development) obligations. Those funds, previously included in DOD's development obligation totals, support the development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year. Therefore, the data are not directly comparable with totals reported in previous years. As of volume 71 (FYs 2021\u201322), FFRDCs are classified as intramural R&D performers, whereas they were extramural in previous volumes; therefore, data are not directly comparable across volumes. Past years in the trend tables have been adjusted to reflect the current classification of FFRDCs. FYs 2020, 2021, and 2022 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act).",
