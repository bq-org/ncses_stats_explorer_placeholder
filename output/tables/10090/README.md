# Relative citation index for 15 largest producing regions, countries, or economies: 2020

**Modal ID:** 10090

**Table Number:** PBS-2

**Type:** CH (Column Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Index)

## Notes

Citations refer to publications from a selection of journals, books, and conference proceedings in S&E from Scopus. Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a region, country, or economy on the basis of the institutional address(es) listed in the article. Articles are credited on a fractional count basis (i.e., for articles with collaborating institutions from multiple regions, countries, or economies, each region, country, or economy receives fractional credit on the basis of the proportion of its participating institutions). Citation counts are based on all citations made to articles in their publication year and in the following 2 years (i.e., 3-year citation window; scores in 2020 are based on citations to articles published in 2020 that were made in articles published in 2020–22). The relative citation index (RCI) normalizes cross-national citation data for variations in relative size of publication output. RCI is computed by dividing the share of the citing region, country, or economy's outgoing citations attributed to the cited region, country, or economy, then dividing that amount by the share of publications attributed to the cited region, country, or economy. An RCI of 1.00 means that the citing region, country, or economy cites publications from the cited region, country, or economy as much as would be expected to happen randomly, showing no particular affinity between the regions, countries, or economies. Scores higher than 1.00 mean that the citing region, country, or economy has a higher-than-expected tendency to cite the cited region, country, or economy’s S&E literature. For more detail, see Table SPBS-39. Cells in which the region, country, or economy collaborates at or above the world average for that year are shaded green.
