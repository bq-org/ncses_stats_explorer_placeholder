**Table Number:** A-3

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Data from 1972 to 1974 are not directly comparable with data from 1975 forward due to changes both in science and engineering fields and in types of institutions covered in the survey. In 2007, newly eligible science fields were added. Graduate student data in this table include master's students in health sciences. For more information on the comparability of these counts to other data published by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, see the "Technical Notes."
