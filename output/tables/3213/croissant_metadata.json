Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Percentages calculated on unrounded numbers. This table includes only institutions reporting $1 million or more in total R&D expenditures in FY 2018. Institutions reporting less than $1 million in total R&D expenditures in FY 2018 completed a shorter version of the survey form in FY 2019 that did not include this question.",
