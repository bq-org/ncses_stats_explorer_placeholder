# Imputed amounts for higher education R&D expenditures, by type of cost: FY 2019

**Modal ID:** 3213

**Table Number:** A-17

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in millions)

## Notes

Imputation rate at total level is lower than imputation rates at detail levels because some institutions could provide totals but not details. Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Percentages calculated on unrounded numbers. This table includes only institutions reporting $1 million or more in total R&D expenditures in FY 2018. Institutions reporting less than $1 million in total R&D expenditures in FY 2018 completed a shorter version of the survey form in FY 2019 that did not include this question.
