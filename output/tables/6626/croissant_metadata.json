Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. This change has affected the comparability of these estimates with estimates published for years prior to 2018. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.",
