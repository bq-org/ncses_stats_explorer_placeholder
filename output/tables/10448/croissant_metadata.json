  "notes": "Not all basic research funded by the federal government falls into the General science and basic research (251) category. Federal funding for basic research arises in other functional categories\u2014such as National defense or Health\u2014and is included in the category funding totals there. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. In FY 2007, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) changed its R&D portfolio to reclassify funding in National defense and most Administration of justice as General science and basic research; in FY 2013, this was reclassified back to Administration of justice. In FY 2004, DHS changed its R&D portfolio to reclassify funding in General science and basic research and in Agriculture as Administration of justice. In FY 2000, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) transferred funding for the International Space Station program from R&D to R&D plant; the change is reflected in the budget authority for Space flight, research, and supporting activities. In FYs 2009 and 2012, NASA revised the classification of its R&D and non-R&D funding. In FY 2000, the National Institutes of Health in the Department of Health and Human Services classified all of its previous development activities as basic research or applied research, with a resulting increase in Health basic research. In FY 1998, many Department of Energy programs were reclassified from Energy to General science and basic research. In FY 1998, the Department of Veterans Affairs began reporting medical care support funds as a part of its total research budgetary resources; the change is reflected in the budget authority for Veterans benefits and services.",
