Race or ethnicity breakouts are for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only. Temporary resident includes all racial and ethnic groups. Starting with 2011, data reflects the Office of Management and Budgetâ€™s latest race and ethnicity categories. Institutions were classified by their sector in the year reported in the table, as provided in the source data. Data are based on degree-granting institutions eligible to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs and do not match previously published data that were based on accredited higher education institutions. In addition, these data may not match previously published data due to small definitional changes.
