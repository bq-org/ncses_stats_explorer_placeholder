For more information on the comparability of these counts to other NCSES published data, see the \"Technical Notes.\" Field titles match the 2020 and later titles in the few cases where field titles changed. Prior to 2020, there were no broad fields in engineering. All fields have been moved to match the current broad field organization. For information on the current of fields and codes in the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering, see technical tables A-16 and A-17.",
