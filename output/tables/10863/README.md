# Federal outlays for research and development, by agency: FYs 2014&#8211;23

**Modal ID:** 10863

**Table Number:** 67

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in millions)

## Notes

Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Only those agencies and subdivisions that had outlays in variables represented by this table appear in the table. Beginning with FY 2016, the totals reported for development outlays represent a refinement to this category by more narrowly defining it to be "experimental development." Most notably, totals for development do not include the Department of Defense (DOD) Budget Activity 7 (Operational System Development) outlays. Those funds, previously included in DOD's development outlay totals, support the development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year. Therefore, the data are not directly comparable with totals reported in previous years. FYs 2020, 2021, and 2022 outlays include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table.
