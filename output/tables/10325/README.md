**Modal ID:** 10325

**Table Number:** 97

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in millions)

## Notes

Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Through volume 70 (FYs 2020â€“21), 11 agencies were required to report data for this section of the survey: the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the Interior, and Transportation; the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Science Foundation. Obligations of these 11 agencies represented more than 97% of total federal R&D obligations in FY 2020. As of volume 71, all agencies report data for this section of the survey; therefore, the data are not directly comparable with totals reported in previous years. Although the nongeographic historical tables incorporate corrections to previously reported data that have been submitted by reporting agencies, corresponding corrections to geographic distributions are rarely obtainable. Geographic distribution of DOD development funding to businesses reflects location of prime contractors and not the numerous subcontractors who perform much of the R&D. Beginning with FY 2016, the totals reported for development obligations represent a refinement to this category by more narrowly defining it to be "experimental development." Most notably, totals for development do not include the DOD Budget Activity 7 (Operational Systems Development) obligations. Those funds, previously included in DOD's development obligation totals, support the development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year. Therefore, the data are not directly comparable with totals reported in previous years. FYs 2020 and 2021 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table.
