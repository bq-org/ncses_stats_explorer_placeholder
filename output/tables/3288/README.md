## Notes

Includes all U.S. citizen and permanent resident S&E doctorate recipients; temporary visa holders are excluded. American Indian or Alaska Native doctorate recipients with unknown or refused citizenship status are counted as U.S. citizens and thus are included.

The greatest differences are in psychology, education, and medical or other health sciences, which are fields with many professional doctorates.
