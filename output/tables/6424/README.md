# Federal obligations for research and experimental development for selected agencies, by state or location and performer: FY 2020

**Modal ID:** 6424

**Table Number:** 89

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Eleven agencies are required to report data for this section of the survey: the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the Interior, and Transportation; the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Science Foundation. Obligations of these 11 agencies represented more than 97% of total federal R&D obligations in FY 2020. Geographic distribution of DOD development funding to industry reflects location of prime contractors and not the numerous subcontractors who perform much of the R&D. FYs 2020 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act).
