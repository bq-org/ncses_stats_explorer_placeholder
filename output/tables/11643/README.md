**Modal ID:** 11643

**Table Number:** 1-4

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the trend fields were constructed using the SED-CIP code crosswalk in table A-6. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information about the field taxonomy changes, see the "Technical Notes."
