  "notes": "Type of R&D estimation procedure was revised for FY 1998 and later years; hence, these data are not directly comparable to data for FY 1997 and earlier years. Prior to FY 2010, R&D expenditures by type of R&D were based on percentage estimates of basic research provided by universities and colleges. Beginning in FY 2010, institutions were asked for dollar amounts of federally funded and nonfederally funded R&D expenditures for basic research, applied research, and experimental development. Because of rounding, detail may not add to total.",
