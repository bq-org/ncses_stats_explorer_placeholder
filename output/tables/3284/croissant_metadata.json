  "notes": "Includes all Black or African American S&E doctorate recipients except those who reported that they did not receive a baccalaureate degree. Those without baccalaureate degrees constitute less than 1% of respondents and are generally citizens of non-U.S. countries who may not have reported baccalaureate-equivalent foreign degrees. Race and ethnicity data are for U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and temporary visa holders. More than 50 institutions are shown due to ties. Baccalaureate institutions with fewer than 5 doctorate recipients are not shown. Institutions with the same number of doctorate recipients are listed alphabetically. Data in this table refer to research doctorates only and differ from doctoral degree data in this report that are based on the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Completions Survey. The greatest differences are in psychology, education, and medical or other health sciences, which are fields with many professional doctorates.",
