For each broad S&E highest degree field, S&E occupations in field includes individuals who report being in an occupation in the same broad category as their highest degree, and S&E occupations out of field includes those who report being in an occupation not in the same broad category as their highest degree. For example, for highest degree holders in computer and mathematical sciences, S&E occupations in field includes those who report computer and mathematical sciences as their occupation, and S&E occupations out of field includes those who report an S&E occupation other than computer and mathematical sciences occupations, that is, who report biological, agricultural, and environmental life sciences; physical sciences; social sciences; or engineering as their occupation. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Percentages are based on rounded numbers.",
