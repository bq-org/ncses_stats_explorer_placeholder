# Federal obligations for science and engineering to minority-serving institutions, ranked by total amount received, by agency: FY 2021

**Modal ID:** 10414

**Table Number:** 29

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Institution order is based on total actual dollars received before amounts are rounded. Only those agencies that had obligations in the variables represented by this table appear in the table. This list of minority institutions is based on the definition of "minority institution" found in the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1067k(3)) and on fall 2021 enrollment data self-reported by the institutions in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. Minority-serving institutions report an enrollment of a single minority group or a combination of those minority groups that exceeds 50% of its total enrollment. The term "minority" is based on the definition of the term found in the Higher Education Act, which includes American Indian or Alaska Native, Black (not of Hispanic origin), Hispanic, and Pacific Islander or other ethnic group underrepresented in science and engineering. Asians or Pacific Islanders (IPEDS enrollment data do not disaggregate Pacific Islanders from Asians) are excluded because Asians are not considered a minority under this program and because studies show that they are not underrepresented in science and engineering.
