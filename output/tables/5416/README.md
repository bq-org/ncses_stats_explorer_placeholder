**Modal ID:** 5416

**Table Number:** 34

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

HHE institutions are those whose full-time equivalent (FTE) undergraduate students enrollment is at least 25% Hispanic, according to fall 2019 data in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, directed by the National Center for Education Statistics. FTE enrollment is calculated as full-time undergraduate student enrollment plus one-third of part-time undergraduate student enrollment. Ranked institutions are geographically separate campuses headed by a campus-level president or chancellor. Some campuses are part of large, multi-campus universities; some are part of state university systems. For a complete list of campuses that belong to a larger university or system and their aggregate R&D expenditures, see table 6.
