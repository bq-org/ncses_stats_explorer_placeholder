  "notes": "Value added is the value of goods and services (gross output) minus the cost of intermediate inputs (energy, materials, and purchased services). Value added is a measure of an industry's contribution to overall GDP. KTI industries include high R&D intensive and medium-high R&D intensive industries based on a classification by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. High R&D intensive industries include air and spacecraft and related machinery; pharmaceuticals; computer, electronic, and optical products; scientific R&D; and software publishing. Medium-high R&D intensive industries include motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers; medical and dental instruments; machinery and equipment not elsewhere classified (nec); chemicals and chemical products; electrical equipment; railroad, military vehicles, and transport nec; and information technology and other information services. The underlying industry data are based on the International Standard Industrial Classification, Revision 4. GDP is in millions of current dollars (not adjusted for inflation). Industry detail is based on the 2012 North American Industry Classification System. Calculations are performed on unrounded data.",
