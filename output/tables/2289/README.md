**Modal ID:** 2289

**Table Number:** S7-34

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Percent)

## Notes

Responses are to the following: There are a lot of issues in the news, and it is hard to keep up with every area. I'm going to read you a short list of issues, and for each one, I'd like you to tell me if you are very interested, moderately interested, or not at all interested. Percentages may not add to 100% because of rounding and because responses of "don't know" and refusals to respond are not shown.
