# Postgraduation plans of U.S. SEH doctorates on temporary resident visas to stay in the United States, by broad field of doctorate and country or economy of origin: 2010–21

**Modal ID:** 11025

**Table Number:** SLBR-28

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Data include doctorate recipients who are on temporary resident visas. Percentages are based on the total number of SEH doctorate recipients on temporary resident visas, including those who did not report their postgraduate location plans or employment plans. Recipients who plan to stay report intending to locate in the United States; definite commitments include doctorate recipients reporting having a definite commitment for a postdoctoral appointment or employment in the United States. The percentage of those who did not report either postgraduate location plans or employment plans ranged from 3.1% to 6.5% over the 2010–21 period. The survey field of study collection changed in 2021, which may affect the data comparability for field of doctorate across years.
