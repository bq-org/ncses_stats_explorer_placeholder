  "notes": "Data include doctorate recipients who are on temporary resident visas. Percentages are based on the total number of SEH doctorate recipients on temporary resident visas, including those who did not report their postgraduate location plans or employment plans. Recipients who plan to stay report intending to locate in the United States; definite commitments include doctorate recipients reporting having a definite commitment for a postdoctoral appointment or employment in the United States. The percentage of those who did not report either postgraduate location plans or employment plans ranged from 3.1% to 6.5% over the 2010\u201321 period. The survey field of study collection changed in 2021, which may affect the data comparability for field of doctorate across years. For more information, see the Survey of Earned Doctorates Field of Study Taxonomy Changes Working Paper (https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses23200); see also https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf24300/table/3-4.",
