# Transition probabilities for the 2015 to 2017 job satisfaction and job importance ALTA model by 2015 job satisfaction class

**Modal ID:** 9169

**Table Number:** 7

**Type:** CH (Column Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Probability)

## Notes

Transition probabilities in this table represent the probability of belonging to a specific job satisfaction class at the 2017 SDR cycle (column) conditional on belonging to a specific job importance class at the 2015 SDR cycle (row), grouped by job satisfaction class at the 2015 SDR cycle. The 2015 to 2017 transition probabilities for the entire sample from the job satisfaction latent transition analysis in table 5 are provided for reference and highlighted in gray. Class stability parameters are in bold. Largest difference in class stability parameters for each 2015 satisfaction class, except Class 2, and the corresponding opposite effect are highlighted in blue. Rows may not sum to 1.000 due to rounding.
