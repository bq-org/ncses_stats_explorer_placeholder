Field of study reporting for the 2019 SDR uses the updated disciplines first presented in 2017, which better align with the NCSES ToD which is based on the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP 2010) issued by the National Center for Education Statistics. This crosswalk displays the field of study aggregations aligned to the ToD.",
