The NSCG estimate of the number of workers in S&E occupations includes postsecondary teachers of S&E fields, and the ACS estimate excludes them. The totals for at least one degree in S&E field and highest degree in S&E field include individuals who are employed and those who are unemployed and out of the labor force. Scientists and engineers are individuals under the age of 76 with a bachelor's degree or higher, are living in the United States, and have an S&E or S&E-related degree or occupation.",
