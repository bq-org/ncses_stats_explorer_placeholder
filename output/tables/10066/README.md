# Institutional collaboration network analysis for AI research papers, by selected region, country, or economy: 2003&#8211;22

**Modal ID:** 10066

**Table Number:** SPBS-98

**Type:** ST (Simple Tabular)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

These statistics were computed for the top 100 institutional producers of AI-related papers. A minimum number of 50 cowritten papers was necessary to establish a link between two institutions. Degree, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality are unweighted measurements, which means that the number of cowritten papers is not used in their computation. Network indicators are described in detail in the Technical Appendix. AI articles refer to publications from a selection of conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journals in S&E fields from Scopus that were classified as AI in the All Science Journal Classification. Whole counting is used in the network analysis.
