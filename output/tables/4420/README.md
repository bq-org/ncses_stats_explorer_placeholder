# Bureau of Labor Statistics projections of employment and job openings in S&E and other selected occupations: 2019–29

**Modal ID:** 4420

**Table Number:** LBR-A

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Thousands)

## Notes

Estimates of current and projected employment for 2019–29 are from BLS’s National Employment Matrix; data in the matrix are from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) Survey and the Current Population Survey (CPS). Together, these sources cover paid workers, self-employed workers, and unpaid family workers in all industries, agriculture, and private households. Because data are derived from multiple sources, they can often differ from employment data provided by the OES Survey, CPS, or other employment surveys alone. BLS does not make projections for S&E occupations as a group, nor does it do so for some of the S&E and S&E-related occupational categories as defined by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES); numbers in the table are based on the sum of BLS projections for occupations that NCSES includes in the respective categories.
