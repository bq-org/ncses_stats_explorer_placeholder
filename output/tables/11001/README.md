## Notes

Data include the civilian, non-institutionalized labor force ages 16â€“75 and exclude those in military occupations, those missing occupation data or who have not worked in the last 5 years, and those currently enrolled in primary or secondary school. The STEM coding used for the Current Population Survey (CPS) occupations differs slightly from the occupations listed in Table SLBR-1 due to additional granularity of occupations available in the CPS data. Details will be provided upon request.
