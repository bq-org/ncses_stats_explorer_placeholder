## Notes

Response rate is the percentage of cases providing data on an item divided by the universe of doctorate recipients eligible to answer that item. For most data items, all doctorate recipient respondents are in the universe of eligible respondents. However, for some of the new survey data items introduced for the first time, not all eligible respondents were able to provide data due to completing earlier versions of the survey but are reported in subsequent years, when the item became available to the entire respondent universe.
