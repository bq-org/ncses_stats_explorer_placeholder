# SED field of doctorate taxonomy, by SED-CIP series/codes: 2023

**Modal ID:** 11750

**Table Number:** A-4

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Field)

## Notes

Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and new broad, major, and detailed fields are used in tables reporting data from 2021 to the present. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. See the SED-CIP level crosswalk to the new broad, major and detailed fields in table A-5; see the crosswalk to the trend taxonomy in table A-6. For more information about the field taxonomy changes, see the "Technical Notes."
