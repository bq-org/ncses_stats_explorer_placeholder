Detail may not add to total because of rounding. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D and are not comparable with estimates published for years prior to 2018. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.",
