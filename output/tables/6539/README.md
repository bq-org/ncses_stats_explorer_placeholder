## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. This change has affected the comparability of these estimates with estimates published for years prior to 2018. For survey year 2008, industry classification was based on the 2002 NAICS. For survey years 2009â€“13, industry classification was based on the 2007 NAICS. Beginning with survey year 2011, the composition of the Other nonmanufacturing industry changed. Most statistics for years prior to 2019 have been revised since original publication. Revised statistics include adjustments based on information obtained after the original statistics were prepared. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.
