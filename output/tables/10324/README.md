**Modal ID:** 10324

**Table Number:** 96

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in millions)

## Notes

Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Through volume 70 (FYs 2020–21), 11 agencies were required to report data for this section of the survey: the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the Interior, and Transportation; the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Science Foundation. Obligations of these 11 agencies represented more than 97% of total federal R&D obligations in FY 2020. Starting with volume 62 (FYs 2012–14), an "undistributed" category was added to the geographic location tables for DOD obligations for which the location of performance is not reported. It includes DOD obligations for industry R&D that were included in individual state totals prior to FY 2012 and DOD obligations for other performers that were not reported prior to FY 2011. This change was applied retroactively to FY 2011 data. Although the nongeographic historical tables incorporate corrections to previously reported data that have been submitted by reporting agencies, corresponding corrections to geographic distributions are rarely obtainable. Geographic distribution of Department of Defense development funding to industry reflects location of prime contractors and not the numerous subcontractors who perform much of the R&D. FYs 2009 and 2010 obligations include additional funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table.
