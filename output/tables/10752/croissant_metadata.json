Value added is a measure of an industry's contribution to overall GDP. KTI industries include high R&D intensive and medium-high R&D intensive industries based on a classification by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The data have been crosswalked to the ISIC, Rev.4, classification. See the Technical Appendix for the crosswalking and Table SAKTI-1. Total private services corresponds to main services in ISIC, Rev.4.",
