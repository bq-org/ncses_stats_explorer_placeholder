Labor force is defined as those employed (E) plus those unemployed and seeking work (U). Unemployment rate (UR) = U / (E + U). Unemployed includes individuals who were not working during the survey reference week but had been seeking work in the prior 4 weeks or who were on layoff from their job. Individuals who reported never having worked but who were still in the labor force during the reference week are included in overall (All occupations) rate calculation but are excluded from computing the rates by occupation. Residence location is based on reported living location on 1 February 2021.",
