# Agricultural sciences and natural resources research doctorate recipients, postgraduation plans by sex and major field of doctorate: 2022

**Modal ID:** 9614

**Table Number:** 9-3

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

A definite postgraduation commitment includes accepting new employment or a postdoctoral study (postdoc) position or returning to predoctoral employment, while postgraduation employment includes accepting new employment or returning to predoctoral employment that is not a postdoctoral study (postdoc) position. Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and new broad, major, and detailed fields are used in tables reporting data from 2021 to the present; see the field list in table A-4. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information, see the "Technical Notes" and the SED 2021 Taxonomy Changes Working Paper (available at https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses23200).
