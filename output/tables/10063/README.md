# Index of collaboration network analysis for AI research papers, by selected region, country, or economy: 2003&#8211;22

**Modal ID:** 10063

**Table Number:** SPBS-95

**Type:** ST (Simple Tabular)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

The index of collaboration is calculated as follows: ICxy = (Cxy / Cx) / (Cy / Cw), where ICxy = index of collaboration between country x and country y, Cxy = number of papers coauthored between country x and country y in the relevant field, Cx = total number of international coauthorships by country x in the relevant field, Cy = total number of international coauthorships by country y in the relevant field, and Cw = total number of international coauthorships in the relevant field overall. AI articles refer to publications from a selection of conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journals in S&E fields from Scopus that were classified as AI in the All Science Journal Classification. Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a country on the basis of the institutional address(es) of the author(s) listed in the article. Only indices of collaboration above 1 between all pairs of countries within the top 60 producers of AI-related research based on whole counting were used in computation of these indicators. Degree, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality are unweighted measurements, which means that the number of cowritten papers is not used in their computation. Network indicators are described in detail in the Technical Appendix.
