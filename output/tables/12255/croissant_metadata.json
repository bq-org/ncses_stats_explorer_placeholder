  "notes": "Beginning in survey year 2021, companies in the known zero R&D group were combined with the unknown R&D group. See \"Technical Notes.\"\u00a0Beginning in survey year 2019, counts reflect a change in rounding methodology. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Beginning in survey year 2017, an initial letter was mailed to all companies that instructed them to report online using the unique authentication code printed on the letter. Companies were said to be known to conduct R&D (known positive R&D) if they reported positive R&D in any of the previous 5 survey years. Companies were said to have known zero R&D if they reported zero R&D in at least 1 of the previous 3 survey years and no positive R&D in any of the previous 5 survey years. Companies were said to have unknown R&D if no R&D information was available.",
