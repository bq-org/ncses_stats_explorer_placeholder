# Gross expenditures on R&D and expenditures for R&D as a share of gross domestic product, for selected countries or regions: 1981&#8211;2017

**Modal ID:** 1888

**Table Number:** S4-1

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (PPP in billions and in constant 2012 billions of dollars, GERD-to-GDP ratio, and annual growth rates)

## Notes

Top eight R&D-performing countries in 2017. Conversions of foreign currencies to U.S. dollars are calculated with each country’s GDP implicit price deflator and with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) PPP exchange rates. Data for the United States in this table reflect international standards for calculating GERD, which vary slightly from the National Science Foundation's protocol for tallying U.S. total R&D. Data for Japan for 1996 onward may not be consistent with earlier data because of changes in methodology. Data for Germany for 1981–90 are for West Germany.
