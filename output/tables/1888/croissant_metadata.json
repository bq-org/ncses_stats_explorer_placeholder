Conversions of foreign currencies to U.S. dollars are calculated with each country\u2019s GDP implicit price deflator and with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) PPP exchange rates. Data for the United States in this table reflect international standards for calculating GERD, which vary slightly from the National Science Foundation's protocol for tallying U.S. total R&D. Data for Japan for 1996 onward may not be consistent with earlier data because of changes in methodology. Data for Germany for 1981\u201390 are for West Germany.",
