# Doctorate-holding nonfaculty researchers in engineering broad fields: 1979â€“2021

**Modal ID:** 8307

**Table Number:** 1-10c

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Field refers to the field of the unit that reports doctorate-holding nonfaculty researchers to the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS). Prior to 2020 there were no broad fields in engineering, and this table included all engineering detailed fields. All fields have been moved to match the current broad field organization. For more information on the mapping of GSS fields and codes, see technical table A-17.
