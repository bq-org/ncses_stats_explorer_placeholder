## Notes

AI article counts refer to publications from a selection of conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journals in S&E fields from Scopus that were classified as AI in the All Science Journal Classification. Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a country on the basis of the institutional address(es) of the author(s) listed in the article. Articles with multiple institutions are counts of articles with two or more institutional addresses. Articles with domestic institutions only are counts of articles with one or more institutional addresses all within a single region, country, or economy, which include single-author articles and articles coauthored under the same institutional address. Articles with international institutions are counts of articles with institutional addresses from more than one region, country, or economy. The number of articles from the "with domestic institutions only" and "with international institutions" categories may not sum to the total article number. This is due to some coauthored publications having incomplete address information in the Scopus database. Those often cannot be reliably identified as international or domestic collaborations. They are in turn not included in either subcategory but are included in the number of articles in the “with multiple institutions” category and counted toward the total number of articles.
