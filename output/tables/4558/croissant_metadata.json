  "notes": "Percentages are based on the number of doctorate recipients who reported citizenship status at graduation. Early career stayers are U.S.-trained S&E doctorate holders who had a temporary visa at graduation (2006\u201315) and who reside in the United States after graduation (2017). S&E, S&E-related, and non-S&E occupations are based on the major occupational classification used in the SDR (see https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/doctoratework/2017/html/sdr17-dt-taba003.html). S&E-related occupations include health-related occupations. \"Not working\" includes early career S&E doctorate recipients who are unemployed or are not in the labor force.",
