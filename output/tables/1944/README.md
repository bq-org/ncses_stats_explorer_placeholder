# U.S. specialization index of patent families, by WIPO technical field: 1998â€“2018

**Modal ID:** 1944

**Table Number:** S8-42

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Index)

## Notes

International Patent Documentation (INPADOC) patent families across all patent offices covered in the Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) are counted according to the year of the first granted patent in the patent family. Patent families are allocated according to patent inventorship information found on the priority patent of the INPADOC patent families. To account for missing ownership information in PATSTAT for some offices, a method designed by de Rassenfosse et al. (2012) is used to fill in missing information on priority patents using information in successive filings within the patent families (see technical documentation for details). Patent families are fractionally allocated among regions, countries, or economies based on the proportion of residences of all named inventors. Patent families unclassified under the WIPO classification are not accounted for in the total when normalization is performed in the computation of the specialization index to avoid underestimating specialization for countries where these unclassified families are more prominent because of data gaps in International Patent Classification codes availability in PATSTAT.
