  "notes": "Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the new broad, major, and detailed fields were used in tables reporting only the most recent data year. The historical fields used to compare the 2021 data with prior years were constructed using the SED-CIP code crosswalk in SED 2021 related detailed table A-6. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years; see the \"Technical Notes\" for more information.",
