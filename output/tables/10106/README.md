## Notes

This table includes only institutions reporting $1 million or more in total R&D expenditures in 2021. Institutions reporting less than $1 million in total R&D expenditures in 2021 completed a shorter version of the survey form in FY 2022, and that form did not collect federally financed R&D expenditures by source and detailed field. For federally financed R&D expenditures by major field at institutions completing the shorter version of the survey, see table 84.
