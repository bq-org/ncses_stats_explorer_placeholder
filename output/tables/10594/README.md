Trademarks are allocated according to holder information. Trademarks are fractionally allocated among regions, countries, or economies based on the proportion of residences of all named holders. China includes Hong Kong. The United States includes Puerto Rico and all other U.S. territories. Trademarks are classified under the 11th edition of the Nice Classification of goods and services, which classifies trademarks under 34 categories of goods and 11 categories of services.
