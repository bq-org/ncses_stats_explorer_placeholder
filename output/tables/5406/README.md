# Federally financed higher education R&D expenditures, ranked by all federal R&D expenditures, by R&D field: FY 2020

**Modal ID:** 5406

**Table Number:** 24

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Institutions reporting zero federal expenditures for FY 2020 are not listed in this table. Tied institutions are ranked alphabetically. Ranked institutions are geographically separate campuses headed by a campus-level president or chancellor. Some campuses are part of large, multi-campus universities; some are part of state university systems. For a complete list of campuses that belong to a larger university or system and their aggregate R&D expenditures, see table 6. This table includes only institutions reporting $1 million or more in total R&D expenditures in 2019. Institutions reporting less than $1 million in total R&D expenditures in 2019 completed a shorter version of the survey form in FY 2020, and that form did not collect federally financed R&D expenditures by source and detailed field. For federally financed R&D expenditures by major field at institutions completing the shorter version of the survey, see table 83.
