**Modal ID:** 6336

**Table Number:** 2-C

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Numbers are rounded to the nearest 50. Standard errors are rounded up to the nearest 25. Detail may not add to total because of rounding.

Those respondents who answered "moderate," "severe," or "unable to do" for any activity were classified as having a disability.
