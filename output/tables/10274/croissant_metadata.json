UARCs are research organizations within a university or college that are established by the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering to provide or maintain essential engineering, research, and development capabilities through a long-term strategic relationship. Only those agencies and subdivisions that had obligations in variables represented by this table appear in the table. FY 2021 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act).",
