  "notes": "Data include the employed, civilian, non-institutionalized population ages 16\u201375 and exclude those currently enrolled in primary or secondary school. Industries were selected if the percentage of S&E, S&E-related, or STEM-middle skill workers in that industry was at least 2.5 times the percentage of all U.S. workers in the indicated STEM group. In 2021, 24.2% of workers were in STEM occupations, 6.2% were in S&E occupations, 8.9% were in S&E-related occupations, and 9.1% were in STEM middle-skill occupations.",
