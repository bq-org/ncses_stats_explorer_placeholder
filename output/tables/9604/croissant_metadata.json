  "notes": "Excludes doctorate recipients who did not report parental education for either parent or reported \"not applicable or unknown\" for both parents' education. If data were provided for one parent, that response is used; when data were provided for two parents, the higher attainment is used. Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and new broad, major, and detailed fields are used in tables reporting data from 2021 to the present; see the field list in table A-4. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information, see the \"Technical Notes\" and the SED 2021 Taxonomy Changes Working Paper (available at https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses23200).",
