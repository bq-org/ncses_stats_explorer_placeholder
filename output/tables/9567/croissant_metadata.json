  "notes": "Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection. The new broad, major, and detailed fields were used in tables reporting data from 2021 to the present, and the historical broad and major fields were used in the tables reporting multiple data years. As a result, the data tables were reorganized and renumbered in 2021 and the field of doctorate data may not be comparable to subsequent years.",
