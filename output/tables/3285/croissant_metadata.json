  "notes": "All S&E doctorate recipients with known disability status are included. More than 50 institutions are shown due to ties. Institutions with the same number of doctorate recipients are listed alphabetically. Doctorate recipients could report more than one disability. Survey asks degree of difficulty\u2014none, slight, moderate, severe, or unable to do\u2014an individual has in seeing (with glasses), hearing (with hearing aid), walking without assistance, lifting 10 pounds, or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Those respondents who answered \"moderate,\" \"severe,\" or \"unable to do\" for any activity were classified as having a disability. Data in this table refer to research doctorates only and differ from doctoral degree data in this report that are based on the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Completions Survey. The greatest differences are in psychology, education, and medical or other health sciences, which are fields with many professional doctorates.",
