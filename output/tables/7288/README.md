# Federal obligations for science and engineering to high-Hispanic-enrollment institutions, ranked by total amount received, by agency: FY 2020

**Modal ID:** 7288

**Table Number:** 26

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Institution order is based on total actual dollars received before amounts are rounded; institutions receiving the same amount of actual dollars are listed alphabetically. Only those agencies that had obligations in the variables represented by this table appear in the table. This list of HHE institutions includes those institutions of higher education whose full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment of undergraduate students is at least 25% Hispanic, according to fall 2020 enrollment data self-reported by the institutions in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). NCES determined FTE enrollment by calculating that approximately three part-time students are equivalent to one full-time student.
