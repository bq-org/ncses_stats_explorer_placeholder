  "notes": "Figures are based on publication year of Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications. Technology areas are derived from the WIPO concordance of International Patent Classifications to technology categories available at https://www.wipo.int/ipstats/en/. Countries are allocated using the receiving office for each PCT application, which is based on the location of the inventors. In cases where PCT applications are filed directly with WIPO via its international bureau, the priority country of the earliest document in the same patent family is used (i.e., where the first application in the patent family was filed). In terms of the regional patent offices, applicants can choose to file PCT applications via these offices rather than their home country. As such, the IPO counts are in addition to the sum of its constituent country counts. The European Patent Office (EPO) is counted toward the EU-27 in the figures because the constituent countries are largely the same. Although the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the EU, it remains a signatory to the European Patent Convention and can still file via EPO. China includes Hong Kong. The world total is the sum of individual countries. There is no row duplication.",
