# Postgraduation plans of research doctorate recipients with definite commitments, by historical broad field of doctorate: Selected years, 1992&#8211;2022

**Modal ID:** 9472

**Table Number:** 2-3

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Percentages based on number of doctorate recipients reporting definite postgraduation commitments and the type of plan (employment or postdoctoral study). A definite postgraduation commitment includes accepting new employment or a postdoctoral study (postdoc) position or returning to predoctoral employment. Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the historical fields were constructed using the SED-CIP code crosswalk in table A-6. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information, see the "Technical Notes" and the SED 2021 Taxonomy Changes Working Paper (available at https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses23200).
