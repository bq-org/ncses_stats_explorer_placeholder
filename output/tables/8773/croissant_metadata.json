For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D and are not comparable with estimates published for years prior to 2018. Statistics are based on companies in the United States that reported to the survey. No systematic item imputation was applied.\u00a0Beginning in survey year 2018, these statistics include an adjustment to the weight to account for unit nonresponse; beginning in survey year 2020, the company counts reflect a change in rounding methodology.",
