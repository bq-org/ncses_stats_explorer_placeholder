Computer sciences include information and communication technologies. Agricultural sciences include agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and veterinary sciences. Social and behavioral sciences include social and behavioral sciences and also journalism and information. Engineering includes engineering and engineering trades, manufacturing and processing, and architecture and construction. To facilitate international comparison, data for the United States reflect the most recent classification in the International Standard Classification of Education Fields of Education and Training (ISCED-F), which vary slightly from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics classification of fields presented in other sections of the report. Data for doctoral degrees use ISCED 2011 level 8. S&E data do not include health fields.",
