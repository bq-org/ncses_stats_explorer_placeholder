**Modal ID:** 10271

**Table Number:** 43

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. As of volume 71 (FYs 2021–22), FFRDCs are classified as intramural R&D performers, whereas they were extramural in previous volumes; therefore, data are not directly comparable across volumes. Past years in the trend tables have been adjusted to reflect the current classification of FFRDCs. Only those agencies and subdivisions that had obligations in variables represented by this table appear in the table. FY 2022 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table.
