**Modal ID:** 10261

**Table Number:** 33

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. FYs 2021 and 2022 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). As of volume 71 (FYs 2021–22), the fields of R&D (formerly, "fields of science and engineering") were revised for consistency with other National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics surveys; some fields were added, merged, or split, and some fields were renamed. Therefore, the data are not directly comparable with totals reported in previous years. See technical table A-3 for additional notes associated with the taxonomy changes to the fields listed in this table.
