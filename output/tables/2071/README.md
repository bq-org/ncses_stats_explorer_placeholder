## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. For an R&D performer that did not report the R&D funders' business activities, no systematic imputation of these business activities was conducted. The business activities of the R&D funders may not be assumed to be the same as those of the R&D performer. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded R&D. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.
