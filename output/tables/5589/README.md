## Notes

Numbers are rounded to the nearest 1,000. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Median salaries are rounded to the nearest $1,000. Designation of full-time and part-time employment status is based on principal job only, not on all jobs held in labor force. For example, an individual could work part time in his or her principal job but full time in the labor force. Full time is based on working 35 or more hours per week on one’s principal job. Hispanic or Latino may be any race; race categories exclude Hispanic origin. The National Survey of College Graduates asks the degree of difficulty—none, slight, moderate, severe, or unable to do—an individual has in seeing (with glasses), hearing (with hearing aid), walking without assistance, lifting 10 pounds, or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Those respondents who answered "moderate," "severe," or "unable to do" for an activity were classified as having a disability.
