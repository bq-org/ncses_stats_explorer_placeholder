# Research doctorate recipients reporting one or more functional limitations, by broad field of doctorate, sex, and citizenship status: 2023

**Modal ID:** 11664

**Table Number:** 5-6

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Doctorate recipients could report more than one functional limitation; thus, counts and percentages for the specific limitations will not sum to the "One or more limitations" columns. Survey asks degree of difficulty—none, slight, moderate, severe, or unable to do—that an individual has in seeing (with glasses), hearing (with hearing aid), walking without assistance, lifting 10 pounds, or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Those respondents who answered "moderate," "severe," or "unable to do" for any activity were classified as having a functional limitation. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and new broad, major, and detailed fields are used in tables reporting data from 2021 to the present; see the field list in table A-4. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information about the 2021 taxonomy change, see the "Technical Notes."National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, Survey of Earned Doctorates.
