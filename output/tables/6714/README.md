## Notes

The values presented here are provided for reference only as they are based on applying the sampling weights to the reduced samples for each collection cycle used for the current project (2015: n = 78,286; 2017: n = 85,720; 2019: n = 80,869) and therefore do not match the official values reported by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics. Percentages may not sum to 100% due to rounding.
