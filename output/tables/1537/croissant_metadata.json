  "notes": "STEM major considers both first and second majors declared by students for their most recent undergraduate degree or certificate. Estimates for mathematics, science, computer science, and engineering majors and social science and psychology majors do not add to total because some students declared majors in both areas. Columns do not add to 100% because each category represents the percentage of all students in that category who declared a STEM major. Social science courses study human society and social relationships and include such courses as anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology.",
