## Notes

Data include active foreign national students on F-1 visas and exclude those on optional practical training. Undergraduate level includes associate's and bachelor's degrees; graduate level includes master's and doctoral degrees. Numbers are rounded to the nearest 10. Detail may not add to total because of rounding and the inclusion of a small number of students who could not be classified according to field of study. The data reflect fall enrollment in a given year and include students with active status as of 15 November of that year. Data in this table differ from previously published numbers due to improved classification of S&E fields.
