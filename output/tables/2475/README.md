## Notes

Intramural performers include a department’s or agency’s own employees who perform R&D and services performed by others in support of an internal R&D project. State R&D totals can display considerable volatility between survey years due to several national and state-specific factors. Large changes are not unusual, especially for discretionary spending items such as R&D.
