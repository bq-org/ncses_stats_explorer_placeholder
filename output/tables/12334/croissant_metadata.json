Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D and are not comparable with estimates published for years prior to 2018. For survey year 2008, industry classification was based on the 2002 NAICS. For survey years 2009\u201313, industry classification was based on the 2007 NAICS. For survey years 2014\u201319, industry classification was based on the 2012 NAICS. For survey years beginning in 2020, classification was based on the 2017 NAICS. Most statistics for years prior to 2022 have been revised since original publication. Revised statistics include adjustments based on information obtained after the original statistics were prepared. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.",
