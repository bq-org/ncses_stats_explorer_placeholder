# Employment sector of research doctorate recipients with definite postgraduation commitments for non-postdoc employment in the United States, by trend broad field of doctorate: Selected years, 1993&#8211;2023

**Modal ID:** 11760

**Table Number:** 2-6

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Percentages are based on the number of definite employment commitments in the United States. A definite postgraduation commitment for employment includes accepting new employment or returning to predoctoral employment that is not a postdoctoral study (postdoc) position. Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100.Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the trend fields were constructed using the SED-CIP code crosswalk in table A-6. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information about the field taxonomy changes, see the "Technical Notes."
