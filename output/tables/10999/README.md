Data include the employed, civilian, non-institutionalized population ages 16â€“75 and exclude those currently enrolled in primary or secondary school. Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. Coding of occupations into STEM categories reflects changes to American Community Survey (ACS) occupation codes following the 2018 update to the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) implemented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Data from 2011 through 2017 use occupations from the 2010 occupation list, while data from 2018 through 2021 use occupations from the 2018 occupation list.
