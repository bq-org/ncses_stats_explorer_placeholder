## Notes

This table shows the number of cowritten articles by all possible pairs of countries within the top 50 producers of coronavirus-related research based on whole counting. Only articles published in 2020 are counted. Any article that had any of the following keywords in its title, abstract, or author-defined keywords was used to build the data set: "covid"; "coronavirus*"; "corona virus*"; "severe acute respiratory syndrome"; "middle east respiratory syndrome"; "SARS-CoV-2"; "spike protein*"; "mers-cov"; "nl63"; "229e"; "oc43"; "hcov"; "alphacoronavirus*"; "covid19"; "covid-19"; "SARSCoV2." Note that the * character is used to specify that the words should serve as prefixes, such that "coronavirus*" also captures articles that used "coronaviruses," for example. Articles, conference proceedings, and reviews indexed in the Scopus database were searched.
