Earnings are expressed in constant 2021 U.S. dollars by inflating pre-2021 earnings observations according to the Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Full-time employment is at least 35 hours per typical week of the survey reference year; part-time employment is less than 35 hours per typical week of the survey reference year. College graduates who have never worked are excluded from this table.",
