**Modal ID:** 7524

**Table Number:** 1-7

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the historical fields were constructed using the SED-CIP code crosswalk in table A-6. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years; see the "Technical Notes" for more information, table A-4 for a summary of SED-CIP codes in the new SED field taxonomy, and table A-5 for a full list of SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy.
