  "notes": "Advanced mathematics covers courses in algebra II, trigonometry, precalculus and analysis, probability and statistics, and calculus. Other advanced mathematics courses include primarily trigonometry and statistics and probability courses. Advanced biology courses include Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) biology, physiology, anatomy, and genetics courses. Advanced environmental and earth science courses include AP and IB environmental science, college preparatory earth science, and various geology courses. Engineering and science technologies courses focus on instrumentation, equipment maintenance, and other technical tasks conducted in engineering and science-related occupations. One Carnegie credit is defined as 120 hours of class instruction over the course of a secondary school year.",
