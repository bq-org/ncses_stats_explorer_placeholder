**Modal ID:** 8010

**Table Number:** 82

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Institutions are included in the short form population if they reported less than $1 million in total R&D expenditures during the previous fiscal year. Institutions can move between the short form and standard form populations as their R&D expenditures increase or decrease; therefore, prior year amounts listed for some institutions may be represented in the aggregate totals for the standard form.
