The possible range of scores for the mathematics assessment was 0\u2013159. The fall kindergarten mathematics scores have a mean of 36.8 and a standard deviation of 11.23, and the spring fifth-grade mathematics scores have a mean of 121.4 and a standard deviation of 15.90. The possible range of scores for the science assessment was 0\u2013100. The spring kindergarten science scores have a mean of 34.4 and a standard deviation of 7.28, and the spring grade 5 science scores have a mean of 74.7 and a standard deviation of 11.76.",
