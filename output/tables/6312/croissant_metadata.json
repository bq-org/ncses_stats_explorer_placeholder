  "notes": "Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. Data for 2010\u201316 come from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics' (NCSES's) annual Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey, which covered all publicly or privately held companies with 5 or more employees. Data for 2017 and 2018 come from NCSES's annual Business Research and Development Survey, which covers all publicly or privately held companies with 10 or more employees. Data for 2019 come from NCSES's annual Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey, which also covers all publicly or privately held companies with 10 or more employees. The total U.S. R&D data come from National Patterns of R&D Resources (2019\u201320 edition).",
