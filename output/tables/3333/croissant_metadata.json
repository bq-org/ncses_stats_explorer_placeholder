Postsecondary teachers of all fields are in non-STEM occupations. Military specific occupations are not included in the CPS data. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. This table will not match previously published tables exactly due to addition of sales engineers to the engineers aggregation. The Census Bureau does not include sales engineers in the engineers aggregation but the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics does. A person with a disability has at least one of the following conditions: is deaf or has serious difficulty hearing; is blind or has serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses; has serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition; has serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs; has difficulty dressing or bathing; or has difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition.",
