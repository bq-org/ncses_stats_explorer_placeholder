# Stage 1 response rate, by institution type: 2017

**Modal ID:** 3816

**Table Number:** A-1

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

All percentages are unweighted and based on the number of institutions within the row under consideration. Due to low response rates and the resulting potential for nonresponse bias in subpopulation estimates, data for the medical schools and centers and the NIH IRP strata are excluded from published tables and figures. However, for research purposes, restricted-use data are available that includes responses from early career doctorates working at medical schools and centers and the NIH IRP.
