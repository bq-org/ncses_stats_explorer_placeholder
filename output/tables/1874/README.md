## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Data throughout the time series reported here are consistently based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Frascati Manual definitions for basic research, applied research, and experimental development. Prior to 2010, however, some changes were introduced in the questionnaires of the sectoral expenditure surveys to improve the accuracy of respondents' classification of their R&D. Therefore, small percentage changes may not be meaningful when comparing data before 2010 with more recent data.
