## Notes

Beginning in survey year 2021, companies in the known zero R&D group were combined with the unknown R&D group. See "Technical Notes." Beginning in survey year 2019, counts reflect a change in rounding methodology. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Companies were said to be known to conduct R&D (known positive R&D) if they reported positive R&D in any of the previous 5 survey years. For survey years 2008–15, companies were said to have known zero R&D if they reported zero R&D in at least 1 of the previous 5 survey years and no positive R&D in any of the 5 years. Beginning in survey year 2016, companies were said to have known zero R&D if they reported zero R&D in at least 1 of the previous 3 survey years and no positive R&D in any of the previous 5 survey years. Companies were said to have unknown R&D if no R&D information was available. For survey year 2016, the target population did not include companies in the Other nonmanufacturing industry with fewer than 10 domestic employees. Starting in survey year 2017, the target population no longer includes companies with fewer than 10 domestic employees.
