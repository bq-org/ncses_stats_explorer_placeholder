# Share of S&E publications in the top 1%, 5%, and 10% most-cited articles in the Scopus database, by region, country, or economy: 1996â€“2016

**Modal ID:** 1853

**Table Number:** S5a-35

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Percent)

## Notes

Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a region, country, or economy on the basis of the institutional address(es) of the author(s) listed in the article. Citation data are based on all citations made to articles in their publication year and all following years and are normalized by subfield and publication year to allow for comparisons across subfields and over time, resulting in the world-level standing at 1% for each subfield and year. A minimum 2-year citation window is needed for a relative citation (RC) score to be computed. This results in scores regarding highly cited articles not being computed after 2016 because the citation window for more recent years is not yet complete. The share of articles in the top 1% is computed as follows: Sx = HCAx/Ax, where Sx is the share of output from country x in the top 1% most-cited articles; HCAx is the number of articles from country x that are among the top 1% of most-cited articles (using full counting, with the exception of papers at the limit of the top 1%, which are fractioned so the world average can stand at 1%); and Ax is the total number of articles from country x with an RC score, which excludes articles released after 2016 and unclassified publications.
