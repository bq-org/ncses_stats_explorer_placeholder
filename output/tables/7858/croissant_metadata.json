Data were not collected on repair or renovation of research animal space in FYs 2010\u201321. Deferred projects are those that (1) are not funded and (2) are not scheduled for FY 2022 or FY 2023. Data in this table, which utilizes repair and renovation project costs, may not match data in table 27, which relies on source of funds, a separate set of survey variables. Details may not add to totals due to rounding.",
