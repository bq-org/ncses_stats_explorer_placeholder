# Costs for repair and renovation of science and engineering research space in academic institutions, by field, research animal space, and time of repair and renovation: FYs 2006&#8211;23

**Modal ID:** 7858

**Table Number:** 18

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Costs in millions of dollars)

## Notes

In FY 2015, "Agricultural sciences and natural resources sciences" was split into "Agricultural sciences" and "Natural resources and conservation." Prior to FY 2015, data for "Natural resources and conservation" are included in "Agricultural sciences." For details on field changes in FY 2021, see "Changes in the questionnaire" in the "Technical Notes" section. Data were not collected on repair or renovation of research animal space in FYs 2010â€“21. Deferred projects are those that (1) are not funded and (2) are not scheduled for FY 2022 or FY 2023. Data in this table, which utilizes repair and renovation project costs, may not match data in table 27, which relies on source of funds, a separate set of survey variables. Details may not add to totals due to rounding.
