**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Thousands of employees)

## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. These changes have affected the comparability of these estimates with estimates published for years prior to 2018. Industry classification was based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Excludes data for federally funded research and development centers. Also available in the full set of detailed statistical tables are statistics on domestic R&D employment, by state; foreign R&D personnel headcounts, by country; and headcounts of leased (i.e., external) R&D personnel, by function.
