Numbers are rounded to the nearest 10. Places of origin are ordered by total number of S&E students. Detail may not add to total because of rounding and the inclusion of a small number of students who could not be classified according to field of study. Physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences. The data reflect fall enrollment in a given year and include students with active status as of 15 November of that year.",
