# Research doctorate recipients who earned a bachelor's degree related to doctorate, by sex, citizenship status, ethnicity, race, and broad field of doctorate: 2021

**Modal ID:** 7557

**Table Number:** 5-2

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Percent)

## Notes

Percentages based on total number of doctorate recipients. Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100. A bachelor's degree is considered as related to doctorate if the doctorate recipient's first or most recent bachelor's degree and doctoral degree are both in the same major field category, except for engineering and education fields, where broad field categories need to be the same. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and the new broad, major, and detailed fields were used in tables reporting only the most recent data year. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years; see the "Technical Notes" for more information, table A-4 for a summary of SED-CIP codes in the new SED field taxonomy, table A-5 for a full list of SED-CIPs code in the new field taxonomy, and table A-6 for the SED-CIP code crosswalk to the historical field taxonomy.
