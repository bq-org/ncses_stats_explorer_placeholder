# Median basic annual salary for research doctorate recipients with definite postgraduation plans in the United States, by broad field of doctorate, type of postgraduation plans, and sex: 2023

**Modal ID:** 11704

**Table Number:** 6-6

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars)

## Notes

A definite postgraduation commitment includes accepting new employment or a postdoctoral study (postdoc) position or returning to predoctoral employment. Basic annual salary is based on the job or postdoctoral study expected to be held after graduation. Median salaries in this table are the 50th percentile of the exact salary data provided and are rounded to the nearest dollar. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and new broad, major, and detailed fields are used in tables reporting data from 2021 to the present; see the field list in table A-4. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information about the 2021 taxonomy change, see the "Technical Notes."
