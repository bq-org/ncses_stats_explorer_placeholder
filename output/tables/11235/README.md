# Federal obligations for science and engineering research and development to historically Black colleges and universities, ranked by total amount received in FY 2022: FYs 2014&#8211;22

**Modal ID:** 11235

**Table Number:** 24

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Institution order is based on total actual dollars received before amounts are rounded; institutions receiving the same amount of actual dollars are listed alphabetically. For the FY 2020 survey, the Department of Defense (DOD) science and engineering support to higher education institutions and DOD R&D support to nonprofit organizations are known to be understated. However, the magnitude of the missing data is unknown. Data users should use caution when conducting any time series analysis that includes DOD obligations data for FY 2020.
