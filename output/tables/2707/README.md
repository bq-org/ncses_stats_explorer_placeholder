## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. For a given estimate in this table, if the conditions are satisfied for both the i and e flags, the e flag is assigned, because the imputation rate may be found in the corresponding table of imputation rates. Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. This change has affected the comparability of these estimates with estimates published for years prior to 2018. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.
