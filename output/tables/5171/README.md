# Relative citation index, by selected country or economy pair: 2018

**Modal ID:** 5171

**Table Number:** SPBS-40

**Type:** ST (Simple Tabular)

**Units:** (Index)

## Notes

Citations refer to publications from a selection of journals, books, and conference proceedings in S&E from Scopus. Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a country or economy on the basis of the institutional address(es) listed in the article. Articles are credited on a fractional count basis (i.e., for articles with collaborating institutions from multiple countries or economies, each country or economy receives fractional credit on the basis of the proportion of its participating institutions). Citation counts are based on all citations made to articles in their publication year and in the following two years (i.e., 3-year citation window; scores in 2018 are based on citations to articles published in 2018 that were made in articles published in 2018â€“20). The relative citation index normalizes cross-national citation data for variations in relative size of publication output. It is computed by dividing the share of the citing country's outgoing citations going to the cited country and dividing this by the share of publications attributed to the cited country. Cells in which the region, country, or economy collaborates at or above the world average for that year are shaded green.
