Seven agencies are required to report data for this section of the survey: the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Science Foundation. Research obligations of these seven agencies represented more than 97% of total federal research obligations to universities and colleges in FY 2020. Only those agencies and subdivisions that had obligations in variables represented by this table appear in the table. FYs 2020 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table.",
