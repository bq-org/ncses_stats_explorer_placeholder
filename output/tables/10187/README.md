# Imputed amounts for total and federally financed higher education R&D expenditures at institutions in the standard form population, by R&D field: FY 2022

**Modal ID:** 10187

**Table Number:** A-15

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Imputation rate at total level is lower than imputation rates at detail levels because some institutions could provide totals but not details. This table includes only institutions reporting $1 million or more in total R&D expenditures in FY 2021. Institutions reporting less than $1 million in total R&D expenditures in FY 2021 completed a shorter version of the survey form in FY 2022 that did not include this question.
