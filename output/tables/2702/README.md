**Modal ID:** 2702

**Table Number:** 8

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Millions of U.S. dollars)

## Notes

Domestic sales are the amount of sales that originated from domestic operations. Foreign sales are the amount of sales that originated from foreign operations. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. This change has affected the comparability of these estimates with estimates published for years prior to 2018. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.
