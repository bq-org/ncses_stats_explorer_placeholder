# Summary of federal obligations and outlays for research, experimental development, and R&D plant, by type of R&D, performer, and field of R&D: FYs 2020–22

**Modal ID:** 10230

**Table Number:** 2

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in millions)

## Notes

Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Percentages are computed using actual dollars reported. FYs 2020, 2021, and 2022 data include obligations from supplemental COVID-19 related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). As of volume 71 (FYs 2021–22), the fields of R&D (formerly, "fields of science and engineering") were revised for consistency with other National Center of Science and Engineering Statistics surveys; some fields were added, merged, or split, and some fields were renamed. Therefore, the data are not directly comparable with totals reported in previous years. See technical table A-3 for additional notes associated with the taxonomy changes to the fields listed in this table.
