# Indexes of internationally coauthored S&E publications, by selected region, country, or economy pairs: 1999 and 2018

**Modal ID:** 1852

**Table Number:** S5a-34

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Index)

## Notes

Article counts refer to publications from a selection of journals and conference proceedings in S&E from Scopus. Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a region, country, or economy on the basis of the institutional address(es) of the author(s) listed in the article. Articles are credited on a whole-count basis (i.e., each collaborating region, country, or economy is credited with one count). Regions, countries, or economies that have contributed to less than 1% of all internationally coauthored articles in 2018 are omitted. The index of collaboration is calculated as follows: ICxy = (Cxy/Cx)/(Cy/Cw), where ICxy = index of collaboration between country x and country y, Cxy = number of papers coauthored between country x and country y, Cx = total number of international coauthorships by country x, Cy = total number of international coauthorships by country y, and Cw = total number of international coauthorships in the database.
