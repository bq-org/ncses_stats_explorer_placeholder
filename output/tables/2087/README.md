## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded R&D. Statistics are based on companies in the United States that reported to the survey. These statistics do not include an adjustment to the weight to account for unit nonresponse. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.
