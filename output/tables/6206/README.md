# Commuting zones with higher innovation rates than predicted

**Modal ID:** 6206

**Table Number:** 5

**Type:** CH (Column Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Share of innovating firms)

## Notes

+ indicates that observed is statistically larger than predicted at the 0.05 level. These estimates are derived from companies with only a single location and may differ from the published innovation counts and estimates based on single- and multi-unit firms (Kindlon 2021). Limiting analysis to single-unit firms eliminates the potential headquarters’ bias resulting from attributing innovation to the reporting location of multi-unit firms and reduces potential measurement error resulting from attributing company reports of innovation to all branch locations. The statistics allow inferences regarding the population of single-unit firms but do not allow inferences regarding the population of all firms. The numbers of observations are rounded.
