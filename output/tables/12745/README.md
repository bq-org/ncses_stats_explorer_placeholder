Detail may not add to total because of rounding. In FY 1998, many Department of Energy programs were reclassified from Energy to General science and basic research. In FY 1998, the Department of Veterans Affairs began reporting medical care support funds as a part of its total research budgetary resources; the change is reflected in the budget authority for Veterans benefits and services. In FY 2000, the National Institutes of Health in the Department of Health and Human Services classified all of its previous development activities as basic research or applied research, with a resulting increase in Health basic research. In FY 2000, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) transferred funding for the International Space Station program from R&D to R&D plant; the change is reflected in the budget authority for Space flight, research, and supporting activities. In FY 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) changed its R&D portfolio to reclassify funding in General science and basic research and in Agriculture as Administration of justice. In FY 2007, DHS changed its R&D portfolio to reclassify funding in National defense and most Administration of justice as General science and basic research; in FY 2013, this was reclassified back to Administration of justice. In FYs 2009 and 2012, NASA revised the classification of its R&D and non-R&D funding.
