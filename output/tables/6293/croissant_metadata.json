  "notes": "Table data include the top eight R&D-performing countries in 2019. R&D expenditures in constant U.S. PPP dollars are computed using the U.S. GDP implicit price deflator. Data for the United States in this table reflect international standards for calculating GERD, which vary slightly from the National Science Foundation's protocol for tallying U.S. total R&D. Data for Japan for 1996 onward may not be consistent with earlier data because of changes in methodology. Data for Germany for 1981\u201390 are for West Germany.",
