# Gross expenditures on R&D and expenditures for R&D as a share of gross domestic product, for selected countries or regions: 1981–2019

**Modal ID:** 6293

**Table Number:** SRD-1

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Billions of current and 2012 constant U.S. PPP dollars, GERD-to-GDP ratio, and annual growth rates)

## Notes

Table data include the top eight R&D-performing countries in 2019. R&D expenditures in constant U.S. PPP dollars are computed using the U.S. GDP implicit price deflator. Data for the United States in this table reflect international standards for calculating GERD, which vary slightly from the National Science Foundation's protocol for tallying U.S. total R&D. Data for Japan for 1996 onward may not be consistent with earlier data because of changes in methodology. Data for Germany for 1981–90 are for West Germany.
