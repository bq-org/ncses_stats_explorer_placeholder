## Notes

Data are for companies with 10 or more domestic employees. Excludes data for federally funded research and development centers. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. For survey years 2014â€“19, industry classification was based on the 2012 NAICS. For survey years beginning in 2020, classification was based on the 2017 NAICS. Most statistics for years prior to 2020 have been revised since original publication. Revised statistics include adjustments based on information obtained after the original statistics were prepared. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.
