**Modal ID:** 10509

**Table Number:** INV-2

**Type:** ST (Simple Tabular)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Data are presented by calendar year. Patents are credited on a whole-count basis (i.e., each participating federal agency on a patent is credited for the entire patent, regardless of coassignments). Articles are credited on a whole-count basis (i.e., each participating federal agency on an article receives credit for the entire article, regardless of coauthors). The sum of the individual federal agencies may exceed the total across agencies because articles may have authors from multiple federal agencies.
