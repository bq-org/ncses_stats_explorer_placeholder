# Doctorate recipients, by selected field and disability status: 2019

**Modal ID:** 3281

**Table Number:** 7-4

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Percentages are based on doctorate recipients who answered the disability question. Doctorate recipients could report more than one disability. Survey asks degree of difficulty—none, slight, moderate, severe, or unable to do—an individual has in seeing (with glasses), hearing (with hearing aid), walking without assistance, lifting 10 pounds, or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Those respondents who answered "moderate," "severe," or "unable to do" for any activity were classified as having a disability. Data in this table are based on research doctorates only and differ from doctoral degree data in this report that are based on the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Completions Survey. The greatest differences are in psychology, education, and medical or other health sciences, which are fields with many professional doctorates.
