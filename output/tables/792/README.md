# Companies in the target population and selected for the sample, by industry and company size: 2015

**Modal ID:** 792

**Table Number:** A-2

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number of companies)

## Notes

Certainties are companies whose probability of selection is one based on prior-year R&D expenditures equal to or greater than $3 million as well as others included in the sample for analytical purposes (analytical certainties). Noncertainties are companies whose probability of selection is less than 1. Companies that were missing or had an incomplete NAICS code at the time of sampling were assigned to an "unclassified" industry category temporarily. If an unclassified company reported R&D expenditures, its primary industrial activity was investigated, and a NAICS code was assigned during statistical processing. The total sample size reflects the time between sample selection and survey mailout; that is, the sample was updated before actual mailout took place.
