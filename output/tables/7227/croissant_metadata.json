  "notes": "Industry and firm size fixed effects not reported. Settlement size categories are the RUCCs constructed by the Economic Research Service using official Office of Management and Budget designations of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes.aspx). These estimates are derived from companies with only a single location. Limiting analysis to single-unit firms eliminates the potential headquarters' bias resulting from attributing innovation to the reporting location of multi-unit firms and reduces potential measurement error resulting from attributing company reports of innovation to all branch locations. The statistics allow inferences regarding the population of single-unit firms but do not allow inferences regarding the population of all firms.",
