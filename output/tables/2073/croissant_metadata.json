For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded R&D. In all other tables, R&D costs of foreign-company subsidiaries of U.S. companies are included in company-funded U.S. domestic R&D totals. Only in this table are such R&D costs classified as being part of R&D paid for by sources located outside of the United States. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.",
