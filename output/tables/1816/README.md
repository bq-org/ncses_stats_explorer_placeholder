## Notes

Gross domestic product deflators come from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and are available at https://www.bea.gov/national, accessed August 2019. Because of rising capitalization thresholds, the dollar threshold for inclusion in the equipment category has changed over time. Generally, university equipment that costs less than $5,000 would be classified under the cost category of "supplies." Detail may not add to total because of rounding.
