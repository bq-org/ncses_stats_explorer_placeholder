# Graduate students in engineering broad fields: 1975â€“2021

**Modal ID:** 8305

**Table Number:** 1-10a

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Prior to 2020 there were no broad fields in engineering, and this table included all engineering detailed fields. All fields have been moved to match the current broad field organization. The pre-2020 data have been master's and doctoral students were not reported separately until 2017. For more information on the mapping of GSS fields and codes, see technical table A-17.
