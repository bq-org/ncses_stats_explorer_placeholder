## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classifications for all countries are based on main activity. The U.S. business R&D data are from the U.S. Business R&D and Innovation Survey 2016 (cross-walked to the ISIC Rev. 4 classifications). In general, the table includes industries with annual R&D expenditures of $10 billion or more (i.e., each country's largest R&D performers). See the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD's) ANalytical Business Enterprise Research and Development (ANBERD) database for a more detailed set of industries by country.
