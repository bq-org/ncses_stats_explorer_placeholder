## Notes

Data for 1985 and 1993–97 are not comparable with data for other years and understate the degree of federal support. In 1985 and 1993–97, the federal support question asked whether work performed during the week of 15 April was supported by the government; in other years, the question pertained to work conducted over the course of an entire year.

Full-time faculty includes full professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and instructors from 1973 to 1995; from 1997 to 2017, full-time faculty includes full professors, associate professors, and assistant professors. Research includes basic or applied research, development, and design. Total includes part-time employment not shown separately but excludes those employed part time because they are students or retired.
