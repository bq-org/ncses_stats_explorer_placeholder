# Domestic R&D paid for by other companies and performed by the company, by funders' business activity: 2019

**Modal ID:** 6583

**Table Number:** 44

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Millions of U.S. dollars)

## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. For an R&D performer that did not report the R&D funders' business activities, no systematic imputation of these business activities was conducted. The business activities of the R&D funders may not be assumed to be the same as those of the R&D performer. Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. This change has affected the comparability of these estimates with estimates published for years prior to 2018. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.
