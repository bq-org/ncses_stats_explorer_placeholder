  "notes": "Companies were sent the detailed survey form (BRDI-1) if their R&D spending was at least $1.8 million in 2007 for the 2008 survey; at least $7.0 million in 2009 for the 2010 and 2011 surveys; at least $7.0 million in 2010 for the 2012 survey; or at least $1.0 million in 2011 or 2012 for the 2013 survey (except companies that did not respond in these prior 2 years), at least $1.0 million in 2012 or 2013 for the 2014 survey (except companies that did not respond in these prior 2 years) and at least $1.0 million in 2013 or 2014 for the 2015 survey (except companies that did not respond in these prior 2 years). All other companies received an abbreviated form (BRDI-1A for 2008-11; BRDI-1(S) for 2012\u201315). For 2010, some companies received BRDI-1B, an abbreviated form that tested questions on innovation. In 2012, we switched from the BRDI-1A to the BRDI-1(S) form.",
