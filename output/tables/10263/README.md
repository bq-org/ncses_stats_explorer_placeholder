## Notes

Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Only those agencies and subdivisions that had obligations in variables represented by this table appear in the table. FY 2022 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table. As of volume 71 (FYs 2021–22), the fields of R&D (formerly, "fields of science and engineering") were revised for consistency with other National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics surveys; some fields were added, merged, or split, and some fields were renamed. Therefore, the data are not directly comparable with totals reported in previous years. See technical table A-3 for additional notes associated with the taxonomy changes to the fields listed in this table.
