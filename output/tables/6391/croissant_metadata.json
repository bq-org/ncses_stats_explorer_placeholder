Seven agencies are required to report data for this section of the survey: the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Science Foundation. Research obligations of these seven agencies represented more than 97% of total federal research obligations to universities and colleges in FYs 2020\u201321. FYs 2020 and 2021 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act).",
