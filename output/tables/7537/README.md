# Postgraduation plans of research doctorate recipients with definite commitments, by historical broad field of doctorate: Selected years, 1991â€“2021

**Modal ID:** 7537

**Table Number:** 2-3

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the historical fields were constructed using the SED-CIP code crosswalk in table A-6. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years; see the "Technical Notes" for more information, table A-4 for a summary of SED-CIP codes in the new SED field taxonomy, and table A-5 for a full list of SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy.
