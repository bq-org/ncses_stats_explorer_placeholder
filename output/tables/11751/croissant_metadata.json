  "notes": "Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and new broad, major, and detailed fields are used in tables reporting data from 2021 to the present. In 2023, two new major fields \"Biological and biomedical sciences, general\" and \"Aerospace, aeronautical, astronautical, and space engineering\" were added to improve data utility. See the summary field list in table A-4; see the SED-CIP code crosswalk to the trend field taxonomy in table A-6. For more information about the field taxonomy changes, see the \"Technical Notes.\"",
