# Postdoctoral appointees in engineering broad fields: 1979&#8211;2022

**Modal ID:** 10672

**Table Number:** 1-10b

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Prior to 2020, there were no broad fields in engineering and this table includes all engineering detailed fields. All fields have been moved to match the current broad field organization. For postdoctoral appointees, "field" refers to the field of the unit that reports information on this group to the GSS. Sum of the broad fields may not add to total because of rounding. For more information on the mapping of GSS fields and codes, see technical table A-17.
