Intramural activities cover costs associated with the administration of intramural R&D programs and extramural R&D procurements by federal personnel as well as actual intramural performance. Only those agencies and subdivisions that had obligations in variables represented by this table appear in the table. Federal intramural amounts for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority are transfers to the other agencies in support of Operation Warp Speed. FYs 2020 and 2021 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act).",
