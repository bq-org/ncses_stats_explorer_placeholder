## Notes

Industry detail may not add to total because of rounding. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. Industry classification was based on dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Application areas are not mutually exclusive as companies could report R&D in one, more than one, or no application area. Additional industry-level data can be found in the full set of Business Research and Development Survey data tables.
