## Notes

Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Eleven agencies are required to report data for this section of the survey: the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the Interior, and Transportation; the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Science Foundation. Obligations of these 11 agencies represented more than 98% of federal R&D plant obligations in FY 2020. Although the nongeographic historical tables incorporate corrections to previously reported data that have been submitted by reporting agencies, corresponding corrections to geographic distributions are rarely obtainable. FYs 2009 and 2010 obligations include additional funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table.
