The research plan provides (1) a consistent life-cycle inventory database for evaluating the environmental performance of wood and alternative materials from resource regeneration or extraction to end use and disposal; (2) a framework for evaluating life-cycle environmental and economic impacts; (3) source data for many users, including resource managers, manufacturers, architects, engineers, environmental protection and energy analysts, and policy specialists; and (4) continuously updated wood products life-cycle assessment (LCA) underlying data for making LCA-based environmental product declaration (EPD) eco-labels renewals easy and cost-effective, and providing valuable environmental performance feedback to industry."
1963,r012_2,,Program,,1,"Program activities: CORRIM research provides a transparent and credible database of information for quantifying environmental impacts and economic costs of wood building materials through the stages of tree planting, growing, product manufacturing, building construction, and its operational use and demolition. Current research provides a component-by-component assessment of environmental impacts to assist in making building design changes that can improve performance along with development of North American-wide EPDs. CORRIM's geographic, product, and building design coverage was expanded in order to identify more opportunities for improved performance. As part of the any wood product LCA and EPD updates, CORRIM addresses pressing research issues including carbon sequestration, temporal and spatial aspects of forest harvesting, land use and land use changes (direct and indirect), and the impact of changes in forest carbon inventories."

1963,r316_2,,Program,,1,"Program activities: The EPA provides and maintains the WaterSense brand and develops national specifications for water-efficient products and programs through agreement and partnerships with interested stakeholders, such as product manufacturers, retailers, and water utilities. EPA requires all products bearing the WaterSense label to be assessed for conformance to the relevant WaterSense product specification by an accredited third-party product-certifying body. Accredited product-certifying bodies are licensed by EPA to certify that products conform to applicable specifications and to authorize the use of the WaterSense label in conjunction with the certified product."

It is a voluntary program that aims to identify and promote energy-efficient products and buildings in order to reduce energy consumption, improve energy security, and reduce emissions through voluntary labeling or other forms of communication about products and buildings that meet the highest energy efficiency standards."
1963,r322_2,,Program,,1,"Program activities: ENERGY STAR boosts the adoption of energy-efficient products, practices, and services through valuable partnerships, objective measurement tools, and consumer education. For products, ENERGY STAR ensures that each product that earns the label is independently certified to deliver the quality, performance, and savings that consumers have come to expect. ENERGY STAR has also developed energy performance rating systems for several commercial and institutional building types and manufacturing facilities, which provide a means for benchmarking the energy efficiency of specific buildings and industrial plants against the energy performance of similar facilities. For buildings and plants, ENERGY STAR tools and resources help businesses determine cost-effective approaches to managing energy use in their buildings and plants, enabling the private sector to save energy, increase profits, and strengthen their competitiveness. The program includes an online tool, ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager®, that calculates an ENERGY STAR score for commercial buildings, which has become the industry standard for rating a facility’s energy performance."

1963,r355_2,,Program,,1,"Program activities: The program provides access to space-relevant environments through the use of commercial reusable suborbital launch vehicles, rocket-powered vertical takeoff, vertical landing platforms, high-altitude balloons, and parabolic aircraft flights. The program entails two activities. Through Suborbital Flight Testing and Capability Development, NASA selects promising technologies from industry, academia, and government, and tests them on commercial suborbital platforms. This approach takes technologies from a laboratory environment and gives them flight heritage, increasing their Technology Readiness Level, while also nurturing the development of U.S. commercial spaceflight capabilities, services, and skills. Through Small Launch Vehicle Technology Development, NASA uses public-private partnerships to accelerate the development of commercial capabilities that enable the frequent launch of small satellites to low Earth orbit at a cost per kilogram of payload much lower than currently available."

Once a company starts selling a product, NASA collects a standard net royalty fee. This allows companies to hold onto their cash while securing the intellectual property needed to carve out competitive market space. Startup NASA licenses are only available for U.S. companies formed with the express intent of commercializing the licensed NASA technology. The startup agreement applies only to nonexclusive licenses, which means other companies may apply for similar rights to use the technology for commercial purposes.

1963,r397_2,,Program,,1,"Program goals: ERCs support basic and translational research on national priorities such as water, clean energy, biotechnology and health care, advanced manufacturing, and critical civil infrastructure. The program aims to integrate engineering research and education with technological innovation to transform national prosperity, health, and security. ERCs create an innovative, inclusive culture in engineering to cultivate new ideas and pursue engineering discovery that achieves a significant science, technology, and societal outcome within the 10-year time frame of NSF support."
1963,r398_2,,Program,,1,"Program activities: The ERC program has three key elements: (1) cross-disciplinary and systems-oriented research, (2) education and outreach, and (3) industrial collaboration and technology transfer. Each ERC is established as a three-way partnership involving academe, industry, and NSF (in some cases with the participation of state, local, and/ or other federal government agencies). Total annual funding for each Center ranges from $3.1 to $19.4 million, with NSF's contribution ranging from $1.8 to $4 million per year, averaging $3 million per year. "
