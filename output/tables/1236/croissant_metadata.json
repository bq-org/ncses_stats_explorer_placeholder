Differences in the number of undergraduates in this table and tables 2-1\u20132-5 primarily reflect differences in the population of institutions surveyed. See U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Estimating Undergraduate Enrollment in Postsecondary Education Using National Center for Education Statistics Data (NCES 2005-063) at http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2005063 for further explanation of these differences. Age categories used are consistent with those used in National Center for Education Statistics tables for the 2015\u201316 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. Detail may not add to total due to rounding. These estimates may not be comparable with previously published estimates due to definitional changes. See https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/npsas/pdf/N16_Data_Info.pdf for more information.",
