## Notes

Data throughout the span of time reported here are consistently based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Frascati Manual definitions for basic research, applied research, and experimental development. Prior to 2010, however, some changes had been introduced in the questionnaires of the sectoral expenditure surveys to improve the accuracy of respondents' classification of their R&D by type. Accordingly, small percentage changes in the historical data may not be meaningful.
