**Modal ID:** 964

**Table Number:** 29

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Percent)

## Notes

Percentages based on total number of doctorate recipients. A master's degree is counted as "related master's" if the fields of study of doctorate recipient's first or most recent master's degree and doctoral degree are both in the same major field category, except for engineering and education fields where broad field categories need to be the same. See table A-6 in the technical notes for a listing of major fields and their constituent subfields based on the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics' field of study taxonomy.
