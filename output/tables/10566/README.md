**Modal ID:** 10566

**Table Number:** SINV-19

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

The analysis of patenting by gender is based on patents granted by the Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Fractional counting of inventors is used, with the credit for each patent divided equally between the inventors. The gender of inventors is determined using the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) World Gender-Name Dictionary Version 2.0, available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/WGND. The process for matching inventor names to genders is based on the WIPO guidelines described at https://tind.wipo.int/record/45020?ln=en. Technology areas are based on the WIPO concordance of International Patent Classifications to technology categories available at https://www.wipo.int/ipstats/en/.
