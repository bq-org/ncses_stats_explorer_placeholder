  "notes": "For the CV, the total number of responding organizations is 3,254. When evaluating total expenses, the CV is 0.5%, well below the 5% CV standard. However, the sample was designed to optimize total expenses, so other estimates are expected to have higher variability. The CV for the proportion of performing organizations and proportion of funding organizations are 12%. The high CVs are largely due to the low proportions of nonprofits that reported performing and funding R&D, 6% (+/\u22121.4%) and 4% (+/\u22121.0%) respectively. However, the confidence intervals are small for both of these estimates. The CVs for the mean performance and mean funding are both 8%. These CVs, based on a subset of organizations that indicated they perform and fund research, meet the CV standard of 30% for the majority of key estimates but not the CV standard of 5% for the top line estimates. Since imputation is a separate criterion, these CV estimates are based only on sampling variance. Table 2 includes additional CVs for total performance and funding amounts by source, R&D type, and field as well as the mean number of full-time equivalents. All but nine of the estimates meet the standard of a 30% CV for key estimates.",
