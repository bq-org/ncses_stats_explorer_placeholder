## Notes

Data in this table differ from doctoral degree data in this report that are based on the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics' Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). SED data are for research doctorates only. The greatest differences are in psychology, education, and medical and other health sciences. Before 2008, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) used two doctoral degree categories: doctor’s and first-professional. In 2008 and 2009, NCES allowed optional reporting in three new doctoral degree categories: doctor's—research or scholarship, doctor's—professional practice, and doctor's—other. In 2010, NCES required institutions to use only the three new doctoral degree categories. With the new reporting system, degrees formerly classified as first-professional (e.g., MDs and JDs) can be reported as doctoral degrees, most often as doctor's—professional practice. In this table, data for 2008 and 2009 include only doctorates reported under the old doctor’s degree category plus those reported as doctor's—research or scholarship. Data for 2010 and later include only doctorates reported as doctor's—research or scholarship. Data are based on degree-granting institutions eligible to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs and do not match previously published data that were based on accredited higher education institutions.
