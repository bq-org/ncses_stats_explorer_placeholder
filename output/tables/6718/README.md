# Model fit indices for job satisfaction latent class analysis models, by selected years: 2015, 2017, and 2019

**Modal ID:** 6718

**Table Number:** 5

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Stability is based on 1,000 random starts unless denoted with an asterisk (*), which indicates that not all 1,000 starts converged. When one or more starts failed to converge, stability is based on the number of starts out of 1,000 that did converge. The preferred 5-class solution is shown in bold.
