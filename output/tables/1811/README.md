## Notes

The countries or economies are ranked based on the 2018 total. Article counts refer to publications from peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings in S&E and indexed in Scopus (see Technical Appendix for more details). Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a region, country, or economy on the basis of the institutional address(es) of the author(s) listed in the article. Articles are credited on a fractional-count basis (i.e., for articles from multiple countries or economies, each country or economy receives fractional credit on the basis of the proportion of its participating authors). Detail may not add to total because of countries or economies that are not shown. Proportions are based on the world total excluding unclassified addresses (data not presented). Data were extracted in June 2019. Average annual change, or compound annual growth rate, is average growth rate = (year 2 publications/year 1 publications)(1/number of years) -1. See Table S5a-1 for groupings of regions, countries, or economies. Detail and other countries are available in Table S5a-2.
