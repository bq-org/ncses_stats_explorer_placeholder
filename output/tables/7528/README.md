# Research doctorate recipients, by historical broad field of doctorate and 2018 Carnegie Classification of doctorate institution: 2011â€“21

**Modal ID:** 7528

**Table Number:** 1-2

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Carnegie classification is based on the 2018 Carnegie Classifications: Doctoral universities - very high research (R1), Doctoral universities - high research (R2), Doctoral/ professional universities, and other universities, which includes all other Carnegie classifications (e.g., special focus institutions) and institutions without Carnegie classifications. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the historical fields were constructed using the SED-CIP code crosswalk in table A-6. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years; see the "Technical Notes" for more information, table A-4 for a summary of SED-CIP codes in the new SED field taxonomy, and table A-5 for a full list of SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy.
