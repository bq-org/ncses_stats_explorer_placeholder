**Modal ID:** 6338

**Table Number:** 1-A

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Numbers are rounded to the nearest 50. Standard errors are rounded up to the nearest 25. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Unemployed includes individuals who were not working during the survey reference week but had been seeking work in the prior 4 weeks or who were on layoff from their job. Number of unemployment spells is the count of times an individual was unemployed on the survey reference week of 1 February 2015, 2017, and 2019. Residence location is based on reported living location on 1 February 2015. Survey asks degree of difficulty—none, slight, moderate, severe, or unable to do—an individual has in seeing (with glasses), hearing (with hearing aid), walking without assistance, lifting 10 pounds, or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Those respondents who answered "moderate," "severe," or "unable to do" for any activity were classified as having a disability.
