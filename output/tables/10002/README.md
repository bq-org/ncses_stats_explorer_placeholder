**Table Number:** SPBS-34

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Articles refer to publications from a selection of conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journals in S&E fields from Scopus. Articles are classified by their year of publication. Closed access articles are only published in toll-access journals. Green OA articles are published in toll-access journals but are archived in an OA archive (e.g., arXiv). Other Journal-Based OA articles include Bronze OA and Hybrid OA articles and are made available on the publisher's website either using a restrictive license or charging an article processing charge to the authors. Gold articles are published with an open license in purely OA journals. Each article is attributed to a single category. Articles that could fit in multiple categories (e.g., Green and Gold) get counted towards the journal-based category. The status of some articles cannot be reliably established, in which case they are not counted. Therefore, the sum of all OA types will yield a lower number than the total output for that year. For more detail, see Table SPBS-86 through Table SPBS-89.
