## Notes

Data in this table refer to research doctorates only and differ from doctoral degree data in this report that are based on the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Completions Survey. The greatest differences are in psychology, education, and medical or other health sciences. American Indian or Alaska Native doctorate recipients with unknown or refused citizenship status are counted as U.S. citizens and thus are included. Definite postgraduate plans are defined as Returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment or Have signed contract or made definite commitment for a "postdoc" or other work by doctoral degree recipients who responded to the question, What is the status of your postgraduate plans (in the next year)? In 2017, 63% of U.S. citizen and permanent resident S&E doctorate recipients had definite plans. Reporting categories for race and ethnicity were expanded in 2013; comparisons to prior-year data should be made with caution.
