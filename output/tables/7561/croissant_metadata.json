  "notes": "Individual doctorate recipients could report more than one functional limitation; thus, counts and percentages for the specific limitations will not add to the \"One or more limitations\" of any type column. Survey asks degree of difficulty\u2014none, slight, moderate, severe, or unable to do\u2014that an individual has in seeing (with glasses), hearing (with hearing aid), walking without assistance, lifting 10 pounds, or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Those respondents who answered \"moderate,\" \"severe,\" or \"unable to do\" for any activity were classified as having a functional limitation. Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and the new broad, major, and detailed fields were used in tables reporting only the most recent data year. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years; see the \"Technical Notes\" for more information, table A-4 for a summary of SED-CIP codes in the new SED field taxonomy, table A-5 for a full list of SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy, and table A-6 for the SED-CIP code crosswalk to the historical field taxonomy.",
