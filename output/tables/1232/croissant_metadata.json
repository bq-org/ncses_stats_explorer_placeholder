Data are as of September of each year. The wording of the disability question was changed in 2017 from \"I do not wish to identify my disability status.\" to \"I do not wish to identify my disability or serious health condition.\" Under the new wording, those who chose to not identify were classified as \"with disability\" which increased the reported number of scientists and engineers with a disability. Previously those who chose to not identity their status were not classified as with a disability.",
