Highest degree in field is the proportion of workers in a particular S&E occupational category with highest degree in the same broad field. For example, among computer and mathematical scientists, these data refer to the proportion with at least one bachelor's or higher-level degree in the broad field of computer and mathematical sciences and the proportion with highest degree in the broad field of computer and mathematical sciences, respectively.
