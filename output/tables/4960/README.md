# Coronavirus-related S&E articles by coauthorship attribute, whole and fractional counting, by region, country, or economy: 2020

**Modal ID:** 4960

**Table Number:** SPBS-55

**Type:** ST (Simple Tabular)

**Units:** (Number of papers [whole counting], number of papers [fractional counting], number of papers by coauthorship attribute [whole counting])

## Notes

Whole and fractional counting of articles is used. Due to international collaboration, the sum of all whole counting numbers is higher than the world total. Only articles published in 2020 are counted. The list is sorted based on decreasing whole counting numbers. When countries are tied for the same rank, they are ordered in alphabetical order. Any article that had any of the following keywords in its title, abstract, or author-defined keywords was used to build the data set: "covid"; "coronavirus*"; "corona virus*"; "severe acute respiratory syndrome"; "middle east respiratory syndrome"; "SARS-CoV-2"; "spike protein*"; "mers-cov"; "nl63"; "229e"; "oc43"; "hcov"; "alphacoronavirus*"; "covid19"; "covid-19"; "SARSCoV2." Note that the * character is used to specify that the words should serve as prefixes, such that "coronavirus*" also captures articles that used "coronaviruses," for example. Articles, conference proceedings, and reviews indexed in the Scopus database were searched. The number of articles from the papers involving only domestic institutions and papers involving international institutions categories may not sum to the total article number. This is due to some coauthored publications having incomplete address information in the Scopus database. Those coauthored publications often cannot be reliably identified as international or domestic collaborations. They are, in turn, not included in either subcategory but are still counted toward the total number of articles. Publications with a single domestic institution count toward the papers involving only domestic institutions category.
