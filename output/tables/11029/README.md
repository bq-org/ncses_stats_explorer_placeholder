## Notes

Non-S&E occupations includes doctorate holders working in both non-STEM and STEM middle-skill occupations because the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) does not produce data on STEM middle-skill occupations. Percentages may not sum to 100% because of rounding. Numbers are rounded to the nearest 100; thus, numbers may not sum due to rounding.
