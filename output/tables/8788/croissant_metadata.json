  "notes": "Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded R&D. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies. To enable comparisons between U.S. Business Enterprise Research and Development (BERD) Survey statistics and those of other nations, in this table an internationally comparable adjusted domestic R&D estimate is calculated by subtracting depreciation relating to R&D operations, which was included in U.S. BERD domestic R&D, and adding capital expenditures relating to R&D operations, which was excluded from U.S. BERD domestic R&D.",
