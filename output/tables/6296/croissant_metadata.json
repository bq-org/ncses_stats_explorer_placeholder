  "notes": "Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. For survey years 2010\u201313, industry classification was based on the 2007 NAICS, whereas for survey years 2014\u201318, industry classification was based on the 2012 NAICS. The 2010\u201316 data come from the Business R&D and Innovation Survey and do not include companies with fewer than 5 domestic employees. Data for 2017\u201318 come from the Business Research and Development Survey and do not include companies with fewer than 10 domestic employees. Data for 2019 come from the Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey and do not include companies with fewer than 10 domestic employees.",
