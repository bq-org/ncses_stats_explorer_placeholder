Computer sciences include information and communication technologies. Agricultural sciences include agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and veterinary sciences. Social and behavioral sciences include social and behavioral sciences, and journalism and information. Engineering includes engineering and engineering trades, manufacturing and processing, and architecture and construction. To facilitate international comparison, data for the United States reflect the most recent classification in the International Standard Classification of Education Fields of Education and Training (ISCED-F), which varies slightly from the National Science Foundation classification of fields presented in other sections of the chapter. Data for first university degrees use ISCED 2011 level 6 (bachelor's or equivalent first degrees) and level 7 (master's or equivalent long first degrees). S&E data do not include health fields.",
