(The National Science Foundation was also in this group, but its corresponding data were not available.) Other federal agencies not listed but included in the All federal laboratories totals are the Department of the Interior, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Invention licenses refer to inventions that are patented or could be patented. CRADAs refers to all agreements executed under CRADA authority (15 U.S.C. 3710a). Traditional CRADAs are collaborative R&D partnerships between a federal laboratory and one or more nonfederal organizations. Federal agencies have varying authorities for other kinds of collaborative R&D relationships.",
