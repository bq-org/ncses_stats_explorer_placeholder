  "notes": "Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. As of volume 71 (FYs 2021\u201322), FFRDCs are classified as intramural R&D performers, whereas they were extramural in previous volumes; therefore, data are not directly comparable across volumes. Past years in the trend tables have been adjusted to reflect the current classification of FFRDCs. Geographic distribution of DOD development funding to businesses reflects location of prime contractors and not the numerous subcontractors who perform much of the R&D. FY 2021 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table.",
