## Notes

Item response rate is the percentage of cases providing data on an item divided by the universe of doctorate recipients eligible to answer that item. For most data items, all doctorate recipient respondents are in the universe of eligible respondents. For some data items introduced in the survey for the first time, not all eligible respondents were able to provide data because they completed earlier versions of the survey, leading to lower response rates.
