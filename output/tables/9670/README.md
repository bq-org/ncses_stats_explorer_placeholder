## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D and are not comparable with estimates published for years prior to 2018. For a given estimate in this table, if the conditions are satisfied for the "i", "r", and "e" flags, the e flag is assigned because the imputation rate and relative standard error may be found in the corresponding tables of imputation rates and relative standard errors (available from the Survey Manager upon request). An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.
