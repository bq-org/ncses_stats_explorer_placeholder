Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classifications for all countries are based on main activity. The U.S. business R&D data are from the U.S. Business Research and Development survey 2018 (crosswalked to the ISIC, Rev.4, classifications). In general, the table includes industries with annual R&D expenditures of $10 billion or more (i.e., each country's largest R&D performers).
