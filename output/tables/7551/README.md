# Research doctorate recipients' sources of financial support, by broad field of doctorate and sex: 2021

**Modal ID:** 7551

**Table Number:** 4-2

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Percent)

## Notes

In this table, a respondent counts once in each source category from which the respondent received support. Doctorate recipients may indicate multiple sources of support; thus, percentages sum to more than 100. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and the new broad, major, and detailed fields were used in tables reporting only the most recent data year. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years; see the "Technical Notes" for more information, table A-4 for a summary of SED-CIP codes in the new SED field taxonomy, table A-5 for a full list of SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy, and table A-6 for the SED-CIP code crosswalk to the historical field taxonomy.
