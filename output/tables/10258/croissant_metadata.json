FY 2022 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table. As of volume 71 (FYs 2021\u201322), the fields of R&D (formerly, \"fields of science and engineering\") were revised for consistency with other National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics surveys; some fields were added, merged, or split, and some fields were renamed. Therefore, the data are not directly comparable with totals reported in previous years. See technical table A-3 for additional notes associated with the taxonomy changes to the fields listed in this table.",
