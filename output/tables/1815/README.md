**Modal ID:** 1815

**Table Number:** 5b-1

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Millions of net assignable square feet)

## Notes

S&E fields and their disciplines were revised in FY 2015.

"Physical sciences" and its subfields "Earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences" and "Astronomy, chemistry, and physics" are now reported under "Geosciences, atmospheric sciences, and ocean sciences" and "Physical sciences," respectively. Data were not collected separately for "Natural resources and conservation" before the FY 2015 survey and are included in the "Agricultural sciences" field for earlier cycles.
