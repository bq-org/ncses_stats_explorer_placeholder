**Units:** (Average score)

## Notes

The scale for NAEP mathematics assessment scores is 0–500 for grades 4 and 8 and 0–300 for grade 12. From 1996 on, data shown here are for students allowed to use testing accommodations. Grade 12 mathematics data are presented from 2005, 2009, 2013, and 2015 only because the mathematics framework was substantially revised in 2005, making prior assessment results not comparable with those in or after 2005. Mathematics assessment was not conducted in 2007, 2011, 2017, and 2019 for grade 12.
