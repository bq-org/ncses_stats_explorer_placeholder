  "notes": "Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Constant-dollar estimates are derived from unrounded data. For trend comparisons, use only the historical data reported in this table because some back-year data may have been revised. Except for the nonprofit sector, data are based on annual reports by performers in NSF's annual R&D expenditure surveys: BRDIS, Higher Education Research and Development Survey, Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development, FFRDC Research and Development Expenditures Survey, and Survey of State Government Research and Development. R&D expenditures by business performers\u2014and, before 2001, also industry-administered FFRDCs\u2014are collected on a calendar year basis. Expenditures for other performers are calendar year approximations based on fiscal year data. For federal performers in 1977 and afterward, the approximation equals 75% of the amount reported in the same fiscal year plus 25% of the amount reported in the subsequent fiscal year. Prior to 1977, the federal fiscal year began on 1 July, not 1 October, and the approximation is 50% of the amount reported in the same fiscal year plus 50% of the amount reported in the subsequent fiscal year. The fiscal year for higher education performers and state government performers generally begins 1 July, and the calendar year approximation is 50% of the amount reported in the same fiscal year plus 50% of the amount reported in the subsequent fiscal year.",
