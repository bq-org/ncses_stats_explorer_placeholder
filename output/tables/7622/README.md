**Modal ID:** 7622

**Table Number:** A-6

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Field)

## Notes

Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 CIP codes were used in the survey data collection; the historical field of study codes re constructed using the crosswalk above. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years; see the "Technical Notes" for more information, table A-4 for a summary of SED-CIP codes in the new SED field taxonomy, and table A-5 for a full list of SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy.
