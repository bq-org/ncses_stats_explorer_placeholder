  "notes": "Article counts refer to publications from a selection of conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journals in S&E fields from Scopus. Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a region, country, or economy on the basis of the institutional address(es) of the author(s) listed in the article. Articles are credited on a fractional count basis (i.e., for articles produced by authors from different countries, each country receives fractional credit on the basis of the proportion of its participating authors). Data are not directly comparable to Science and Engineering Indicators 2020; see the Technical Appendix for information on data filters. The sum of the fractional count for regions, countries, and economies may not add to the world total because of rounding. Some publications have incomplete address information for coauthored publications in the Scopus database. The Unassigned category count is the sum of fractional counts for publications that cannot be assigned to a region, country, or economy.",
