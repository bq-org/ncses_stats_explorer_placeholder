  "notes": "Beginning in survey year 2019, counts reflect a change in rounding methodology. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Certainties are companies whose probability of selection is 1 based on prior year R&D expenditures equal to or greater than $3 million as well as others included in the sample for analytical purposes (analytical certainties). Noncertainties are companies whose probability of selection is less than 1. Companies that were missing or had an incomplete NAICS code at the time of sampling were assigned to an Unclassified industry category temporarily. If an unclassified company reported R&D expenditures, its primary industrial activity was investigated, and a NAICS code was assigned during statistical processing.",
