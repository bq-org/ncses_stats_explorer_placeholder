  "notes": "Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Through volume 70 (FYs 2020\u201321), 11 agencies were required to report data for this section of the survey: the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the Interior, and Transportation; the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Science Foundation. Obligations of these 11 agencies represented more than 98% of federal R&D plant obligations in FY 2020. As of volume 71, all agencies report data for this section of the survey; therefore, the data are not directly comparable with totals reported in previous years. Although the nongeographic historical tables incorporate corrections to previously reported data that have been submitted by reporting agencies, corresponding corrections to geographic distributions are rarely obtainable. FYs 2020, 2021, and 2022 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table.",
