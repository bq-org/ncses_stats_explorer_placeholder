  "notes": "Data include the civilian, non-institutionalized population ages 16\u201375 and exclude those in military occupations, those missing occupation data or who have not worked in the last 5 years, and those currently enrolled in primary or secondary school. Coding of occupations into STEM categories reflects changes to American Community Survey (ACS) occupation codes following the 2018 update to the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) implemented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Data from 2016 through 2017 use occupations from the 2010 occupation list, while data from 2018 through 2021 use occupations from the 2018 occupation list. Data for 2020 are not available due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ACS data collection for the survey year. Additional information is available at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/experimental-data/2020-1-year-pums.html.",
