# Transition probabilities for the five-class job importance latent transition analysis: 2015, 2017, and 2019

**Modal ID:** 9165

**Table Number:** 3

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Probability)

## Notes

Transition probabilities in this table represent the probability of belonging to a specific job importance class at a given SDR cycle (column) conditional on belonging to a specific job importance class at the previous SDR cycle (row). Transition probabilities on the main diagonal represent the probability of being in the same class at both SDR cycles (i.e., class stability parameters) and are highlighted in bold. Rows may not sum to 1.000 due to rounding.
