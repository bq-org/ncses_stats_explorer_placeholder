**Modal ID:** 10935

**Table Number:** RD-3

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Billions of current dollars, billions of constant 2017 dollars, and percent distribution)

## Notes

Data throughout the time series reported here are consistently based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Frascati Manual 2015 (OECD 2015) definitions for basic research, applied research, and experimental development. Prior to 2010, however, some changes were introduced in the questionnaires of the sectoral expenditure surveys to improve the accuracy of respondents' classification of their R&D by type. Accordingly, small percentage changes in the historical data may not be meaningful.
