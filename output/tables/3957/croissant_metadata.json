Intramural activities cover costs associated with the administration of intramural R&D programs and extramural R&D procurements by federal personnel as well as actual intramural performance. Only those agencies and subdivisions that had obligations in variables represented by this table appear in the table. FY 2020 preliminary data do not include obligations from supplemental COVID-19 related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with agencies listed in this table.",
