## Notes

Plant variety protections are allocated according to holder information.Â Data were extracted from a UPOV document reporting on plant variety protections published for the 52nd ordinary session of the Council (November 2018). These data include official statistics reported by 75 national offices to the UPOV (data are complete for 43 of these offices, 11 offices are missing data for a single year, 5 offices are missing data for 2 years, and the remaining 16 offices are missing more years). Data are not available before 2007 as the UPOV does not present subdivided data per resident countries for the office in charge of the European Union. The EU includes 28 member countries. China includes Hong Kong and might also include Taiwan as it does not appear as a standalone country in the UPOV reports.
