# Funds spent for business R&D performed in the United States, by state and source of funds: 2018

**Modal ID:** 2358

**Table Number:** 4

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Millions of U.S. dollars)

## Notes

Beginning in survey year 2018, companies that performed or funded less than $50,000 of R&D were excluded from tabulation. These companies in aggregate represented a very small share of total R&D expenditures in prior years. Had the companies under this threshold been included in the 2018 estimates, they would have contributed approximately $90 million to overall R&D expenditures. Excludes data for federally funded research and development centers.
