# Research doctorate recipients, by historical broad and major field of doctorate: 2017â€“21

**Modal ID:** 7645

**Table Number:** 5

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the historical fields were reconstructed using the crosswalk in table A-3. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years. See table A-1 for a full list of SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy and table A-2 for a summary of the new SED field of taxonomy.
