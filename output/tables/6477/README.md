## Notes

Beginning in survey year 2019, counts reflect a change in rounding methodology. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Companies were said to be known to conduct R&D (known positive R&D) if they reported positive R&D in any of the previous 5 survey years. For survey years 2008â€“15, companies were said to have known zero R&D if they reported zero R&D in at least 1 of the previous 5 survey years and no positive R&D in any of the 5 years. Beginning in survey year 2016, companies were said to have known zero R&D if they reported zero R&D in at least 1 of the previous 3 survey years and no positive R&D in any of the previous 5 survey years. Companies were said to be unknown if no R&D information was available.
