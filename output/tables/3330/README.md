## Notes

Numbers rounded to nearest 50. Detail may not add to total because of rounding and suppression and because respondents could answer "yes" to more than one category of academic position. Survey of Doctorate Recipients asks the degree of difficulty—none, slight, moderate, severe, or unable to do—an individual has in seeing (with glasses); hearing (with hearing aid); walking without assistance; lifting 10 pounds; or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Respondents who answered "moderate," "severe," or "unable to do" for any activity were classified as having a disability.
