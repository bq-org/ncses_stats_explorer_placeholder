# Doctoral SED-CIP code crosswalk to trend broad, major, and fine fields: 2023

**Modal ID:** 11752

**Table Number:** A-6

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Field)

## Notes

Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the trend fields were constructed using the SED-CIP code crosswalk in this table. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. See table A-4 for a summary of SED-CIP codes in the new SED field taxonomy and table A-5 for the full list of SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy. For more information, see "Technical Notes" and the SED 2021 Taxonomy Changes Working Paper (available at https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses23200).
