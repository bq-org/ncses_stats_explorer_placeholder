  "notes": "Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the trend fields were constructed using the SED-CIP code crosswalk in this table. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. See table A-4 for a summary of SED-CIP codes in the new SED field taxonomy and table A-5 for the full list of SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy. For more information, see \"Technical Notes\" and the SED 2021 Taxonomy Changes Working Paper (available at https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses23200).",
