The out-of-field rate and involuntarily out-of-field rate are for employed individuals only. The involuntarily out-of-field rate is the proportion of all employed individuals who report that their job is not related to their field of highest degree because a job in their highest degree field was not available. Median annual earnings are rounded to the nearest $1,000. Numbers and percentages may not sum due to rounding.",
