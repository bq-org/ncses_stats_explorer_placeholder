**Modal ID:** 7567

**Table Number:** 6-6

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars)

## Notes

Basic annual salary is based on the job or postdoctoral study expected to hold in the next year. Median salaries in this table are the exact salary values of respondents at the 50th percentile of their frequency distribution; salary values are rounded to the nearest dollar. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and the new broad, major, and detailed fields were used in tables reporting only the most recent data year. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years; see the "Technical Notes" for more information, table A-4 for a summary of SED-CIP codes in the new SED field taxonomy, table A-5 for a full list of SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy, and table A-6 for the SED-CIP code crosswalk to the historical field taxonomy.
