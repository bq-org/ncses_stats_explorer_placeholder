# Bureau of Labor Statistics projections of occupational employment: 2016&#8211;26

**Modal ID:** 1618

**Table Number:** S3-3

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Thousands)

## Notes

Estimates of current and projected employment for the 2016–26 period are from BLS's National Employment Matrix. Data in the matrix are from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) Survey and the Current Population Survey (CPS). Together, these sources cover paid workers, self-employed workers, and unpaid family workers in all industries, agriculture, and private households. Because the numbers are derived from multiple sources, data can often differ from employment data provided by the OES Survey, CPS, or other employment surveys alone. BLS does not make projections for S&E occupations as a group; numbers in the table are based on the sum of BLS projections in occupations that the National Science Foundation considers S&E. Detail may not add to total because of rounding.
