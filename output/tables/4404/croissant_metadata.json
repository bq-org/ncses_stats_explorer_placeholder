For each broad S&E highest degree field, S&E occupations in field include individuals who report being in an occupation in the same broad category as their highest degree, and S&E occupations out of field include those who report being in an occupation not in the same broad category as their highest degree. For example, for highest degree holders in computer and mathematical sciences, S&E occupations in field include those who report computer and mathematical sciences as their occupation, and S&E occupations out of field include those who report an S&E occupation other than computer and mathematical sciences occupations, that is, who report biological, agricultural, and environmental life sciences; physical sciences; social sciences; or engineering as their occupation. Percentages may not add to 100% because of rounding.",
