# Employment sector of research doctorate recipients with definite postgraduation commitments for employment in the United States, by historical broad field of doctorate: Selected years, 1992&#8211;2022

**Modal ID:** 9467

**Table Number:** 2-6

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Percentages based on number of doctorate recipients reporting definite employment commitments in the United States. A definite postgraduation commitment for employment includes accepting new employment or returning to predoctoral employment that is not a postdoctoral study (postdoc) position. Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the historical fields were constructed using the SED-CIP code crosswalk in table A-6. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information, see the "Technical Notes" and the SED 2021 Taxonomy Changes Working Paper (available at https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses23200).
