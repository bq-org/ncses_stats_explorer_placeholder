Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Sum of "Yes" and "No" responses may not add to the total number of companies or, for the percentages, to 100% due to item nonresponse to some items.
