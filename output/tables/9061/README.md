## Notes

Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a region, country, or economy on the basis of the institutional address(es) of the author(s) listed in the article. Whole counting is used. An article is considered to be federally funded if the funding information tied with the publication record in Scopus links it with one of the U.S. federal agencies. Not all Scopus publications have funding information available, and coverage has evolved with time. For more information, see Figure SPBS-1. For a breakdown of federally funded papers by funding agency, see Table SPBS-90.
