**Modal ID:** 11749

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

## Notes

Survey items listed above are those utilized in the data tables. Survey item response rate is the percentage of cases providing data on an item divided by the universe of doctorate recipients eligible to answer that item, consistent with American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) response rate calculation 3. For most data items, all doctorate recipient respondents are in the universe of eligible respondents. Institution-provided data may be used for some items when respondents do not provide the data; thus response rates for those items are higher than the survey response rate. The item source refers to the question numbers in the SED questionnaire for the most recent survey year in this table: https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/earned-doctorates-2023.pdf
