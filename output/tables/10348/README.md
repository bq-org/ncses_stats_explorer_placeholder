## Notes

Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. As of volume 71 (FYs 2021–22), FFRDCs are presented as intramural R&D, whereas they were presented as extramural in previous survey data. Data in trend tables have been revised to reflect the new classification. Only those agencies and subdivisions that had obligations in variables represented by this table appear in the table. FY 2021 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19 pandemic-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act).
