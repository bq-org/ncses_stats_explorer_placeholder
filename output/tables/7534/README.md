**Modal ID:** 7534

**Table Number:** 1-14

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Percent)

## Notes

Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding and doctorate recipients who reported "not applicable or unknown" for both parents' education or did not report either parent's education. If a respondent provided data for one parent, that response is used; for respondents who provided data for two parents, the higher attainment is reported in this table.
