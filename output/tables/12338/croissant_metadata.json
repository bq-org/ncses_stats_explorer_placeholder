  "notes": "Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. To enable comparisons between U.S. statistics from the BERD Survey and statistics from other nations, in this table an internationally comparable adjusted domestic R&D estimate is calculated by subtracting depreciation relating to R&D operations, which is included in U.S. R&D from the BERD Survey, and adding capital expenditures relating to R&D operations, which is excluded from U.S. R&D from the BERD Survey.",
