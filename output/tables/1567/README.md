## Notes

Racial and ethnic breakouts include U.S. citizens and permanent residents only; temporary visa holder includes all racial and ethnic groups. Doctoral degree data in this table differ from doctoral degree data in other tables and figures in this report that are based on the National Science Foundation Survey of Earned Doctorates and that refer to research doctorates only. The greatest differences are in psychology, education, and medical and other health sciences. Before 2008, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) used two doctoral degree categories (doctor's and first-professional). Data in this table for those years include only the doctor's category. In 2008 and 2009, NCES allowed optional reporting in three new doctoral degree categories (doctor's degree-research/scholarship, doctor's degree-professional practice, and doctor's degree-other) in addition to the doctor's category. For those 2 years, data in this table include only doctorates reported in the doctor's category plus those reported in doctor's degree-research/scholarship. In 2010, NCES required institutions to use only the three new doctoral degree categories, and data in this table for 2010 and later include only doctorates reported in the category doctor's degree-research/scholarship. This change primarily affects data for other health sciences.
