**Units:** (Number and percent)

## Notes

Hispanic or Latino may be any race; race categories exclude Hispanic origin. HHEs are defined by the Department of Education as nonprofit public and private institutions of higher education whose full-time equivalent enrollment of undergraduate students is at least 25% Hispanic, according to data that institutions reported in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Fall 2018 Enrollment Survey, conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. Because HHEs were identified using the 2018 Enrollment Survey data for all years, these estimates are not comparable to previous years’ tables. Data are based on degree-granting institutions eligible to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs.
