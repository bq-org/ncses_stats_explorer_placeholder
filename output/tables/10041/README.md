# Share of S&E publications in the top 1% most-cited journal articles in biological and biomedical sciences, whole count, by region, country, or economy: 2003–20

**Modal ID:** 10041

**Table Number:** SPBS-73

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Percent)

## Notes

Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a region, country, or economy on the basis of the institutional address(es) of the author(s) listed in the article. Articles are credited on a whole count basis. In whole counting, each region, country, or economy with a collaborating author on an article is credited with one count. Citation data are based on all citations made to articles in their publication year and all following years and are normalized by subfield and publication year to allow for comparisons across subfields and over time, resulting in the world level standing at 1% for each subfield and year. The impact of conference proceedings is excluded from this calculation. A minimum 2-year citation window is needed for a score to be computed. This results in scores regarding highly cited articles not being computed after 2020 because the citation window for more recent years is not yet complete. The share of articles in the top 1% is computed as follows: Sx = HCAx / Ax, where Sx is the share of output from country x in the top 1% most-cited articles; HCAx is the number of articles from country x that are among the top 1% of most-cited articles (using full counting, with the exception of papers at the limit of the top 1%, which are fractioned so the world average can stand at 1%); and Ax is the total number of articles from country x excluding articles released after 2020 and unclassified publications. The relative citation score takes into consideration the citation behavior between fields and years of publication. Cells where the region, country, or economy is cited more than the world average for that year are shaded green.
