If respondent was not employed during survey reference period, occupation when last employed was reported. Excludes 350 individuals who reported never having worked so could not be classified by occupation. Designation of full-time and part-time employment status is based on principal job only, not on all jobs held in labor force. For example, an individual could work part time in his or her principal job but full time in the labor force. Full time is based on working 35 or more hours per week. Residence location is based on reported living location on 1 February 2019.",
