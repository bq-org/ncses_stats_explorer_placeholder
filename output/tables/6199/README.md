## Notes

Value added is a net measure of output; it is the difference between the value of goods and services produced by an industry (gross output) and the total cost of intermediate inputs that were used in production, including energy, materials, and services purchased from other businesses. Industry value added is a measure of an industry's contribution to overall GDP. KTI industries include high R&D intensive and medium-high R&D intensive industries based on a classification by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The data have been crosswalked to the ISIC, Rev.4, classification. See the Technical Appendix for the crosswalking method and Table SKTI-1 for historical data on these industries.
