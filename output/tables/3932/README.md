**Modal ID:** 3932

**Table Number:** 66

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Seven agencies are required to report data for this section of the survey: the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Science Foundation. Basic research obligations of these seven agencies represented more than 99% of total federal basic research obligations to universities and colleges in FYs 2019–20. FY 2020 preliminary data do not include obligations from supplemental COVID-19 related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act).
