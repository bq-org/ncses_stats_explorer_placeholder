Involuntarily out-of-field rate is the percentage of employed individuals who reported, for their principal job, working in an area not related to their first doctoral degree at least partially because a job in their doctoral degree field was not available. If respondent was not employed during survey reference period, occupation when last employed was reported. Residence location is based on reported living location on 1 February 2021.",
