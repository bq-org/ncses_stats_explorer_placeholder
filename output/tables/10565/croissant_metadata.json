  "notes": "Granted patents for all patent authorities are allocated according to patent inventorship information. AI patents are identified and divided into categories using filters consisting of Cooperative Patent Classifications and International Patent Classifications plus keywords and phrases. Details of these filters can be found at https://github.com/georgetown-cset/1790-ai-patent-data/. Only the first granted patent in each patent family is counted so as to avoid double counting the same invention. Patent families containing no granted patents are excluded. Country assignments are based on fractional counting of inventor locations as listed in the associated record from the Global Patent Index. If no inventor countries are listed, the priority country is used (i.e., where the first application in the patent family was filed). The patent families in the AI patent database are categorized along three dimensions, available at https://github.com/georgetown-cset/1790-ai-patent-data:\u25cf AI techniques: How does the invention work? (e.g., machine learning, logic models, fuzzy logic)\u25cf Functional applications: What does the invention do? (e.g., speech processing, computer vision, control systems)\u25cf Application fields: Where can the invention be used? (e.g., life sciences, transportation, energy management)The three dimensions build on the Computing Classification System developed by the Association for Computing Machinery. Within each dimension, a patent family may be included in more than one category. China includes Hong Kong.",
