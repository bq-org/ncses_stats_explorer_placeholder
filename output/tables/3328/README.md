## Notes

Numbers rounded to nearest 50, and median salaries rounded to nearest $1,000. Detail may not add to total because of rounding and suppression. Total includes Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and persons of more than one race who are not Hispanic or Latino. Survey of Doctorate Recipients asks the degree of difficulty—none, slight, moderate, severe, or unable to do—an individual has in seeing (with glasses); hearing (with hearing aid); walking without assistance; lifting 10 pounds; or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Respondents who answered "moderate," "severe," or "unable to do" for any activity were classified as having a disability. Field of study reporting for the 2019 Survey of Doctorate Recipients was updated to better align with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistic’s taxonomy of disciplines (ToD). The ToD is based on the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP 2010) issued by the National Center for Education Statistics.
