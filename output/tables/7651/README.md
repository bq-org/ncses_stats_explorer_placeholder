**Modal ID:** 7651

**Table Number:** A-3

## Notes

Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 CIP codes was used in the survey data collection; the historical fields were reconstructed using the crosswalk above. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years; see the "Technical Notes" for more information, table A-2 for a summary of SED-CIP codes in the new SED field taxonomy, and table A-1 for a full list ofÂ SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy.
