# Imputed amounts for higher education R&D expenditures, by type of cost: FY 2020

**Modal ID:** 5365

**Table Number:** A-17

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Dollars in thousands)

## Notes

Imputation rate at total level is lower than imputation rates at detail levels because some institutions could provide totals but not details. This table includes only institutions reporting $1 million or more in total R&D expenditures in FY 2019. Institutions reporting less than $1 million in total R&D expenditures in FY 2019 completed a shorter version of the survey form in FY 2020 that did not include this question.
