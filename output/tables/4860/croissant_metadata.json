The data were filtered in a similar manner as the Scopus data used throughout this report. The filters removed preprints, letters, notes, editorials, errata, surveys, low-quality journals, or lack of institutional addresses. Any article that had any of the following keywords in its title, abstract, or author-defined keywords were used to build the data set: \"covid\"; \"coronavirus*\"; \"corona virus*\"; \"severe acute respiratory syndrome\"; \"middle east respiratory syndrome\"; \"SARS-CoV-2\"; \"spike protein*\"; \"mers-cov\"; \"nl63\"; \"229e\"; \"oc43\"; \"hcov\"; \"alphacoronavirus*\"; \"covid19\"; \"covid-19\"; \"SARSCoV2.\" The * character is used to specify that the words should serve as prefixes, such that \"coronavirus*\" also captures articles that used \"coronaviruses,\" for example. Articles, conference proceedings, and reviews indexed in the Scopus database were searched. For additional detail, see Table SPBS-55.",
