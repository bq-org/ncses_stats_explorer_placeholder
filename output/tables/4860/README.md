## Notes

Number of publications uses fractional counting. The list is sorted based on decreasing fractional counting numbers. The data were filtered in a similar manner as the Scopus data used throughout this report. The filters removed preprints, letters, notes, editorials, errata, surveys, low-quality journals, or lack of institutional addresses. Any article that had any of the following keywords in its title, abstract, or author-defined keywords were used to build the data set: "covid"; "coronavirus*"; "corona virus*"; "severe acute respiratory syndrome"; "middle east respiratory syndrome"; "SARS-CoV-2"; "spike protein*"; "mers-cov"; "nl63"; "229e"; "oc43"; "hcov"; "alphacoronavirus*"; "covid19"; "covid-19"; "SARSCoV2." The * character is used to specify that the words should serve as prefixes, such that "coronavirus*" also captures articles that used "coronaviruses," for example. Articles, conference proceedings, and reviews indexed in the Scopus database were searched. For additional detail, see Table SPBS-55.
