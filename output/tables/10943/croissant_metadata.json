R&D is basic research, applied research, and experimental development, and it does not include R&D plant. Intramural activities include actual intramural R&D performance and costs associated with planning and administration of both intramural and extramural programs by federal personnel, including federally funded research and development centers. Extramural performers includes federally funded R&D performed in the United States and U.S. territories by businesses, universities and colleges, other nonprofit institutions, state and local governments, and foreign organizations. FY 2022 obligations include additional funding provided by supplemental COVID-19-related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act).
