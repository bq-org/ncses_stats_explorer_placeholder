The 2015 to 2017 transition probabilities for the entire sample from the job satisfaction LTA in table 5 are provided for reference and highlighted in gray. Class stability parameters are in bold. Select cells discussed in the text are highlighted in blue. Rows may not sum to 1.000 due to rounding.",
