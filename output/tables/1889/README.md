# Federal obligations for R&D and R&D plant, by type of work: FYs 1953&#8211;2018

**Modal ID:** 1889

**Table Number:** S4-2

**Type:** TS (Time Series)

**Units:** (Millions of current and constant 2012 dollars)

## Notes

Beginning in FY 2016 (and continuing in subsequent years), agency reports of obligations for R&D reflect the application of a definition for development that is narrowed to "experimental development." This revision was introduced to align federal R&D budget formulation to be consistent with the Office of Management and Budget's Circular A-11, Section 84. This change in definition applies to all agencies, but the predominant impact is that the Department of Defense's (DOD's) Operational Systems Development (Budget Activity 7) is no longer included as development. DOD Operational Systems Development was about $24.6 billion in FY 2016, $26.0 billion in FY 2017, and $26.7 billion in FY 2018. Accordingly, the obligations data listed above for FYs 2016–18 are not directly comparable with those for FY 2015 and earlier years.
