## Notes

State R&D expenditures by function were surveyed beginning with the FY 2009 survey. State R&D totals can display considerable volatility between survey years due to several national and state-specific factors. Large changes are not unusual, especially for discretionary spending items such as R&D. Other R&D functions include, but are not limited to, corrections, criminal justice, education, forensic science, labor, public safety, and social services.
