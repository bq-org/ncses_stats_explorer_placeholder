## Notes

Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) Survey employment data do not cover employment in some sectors of the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting industry; in private households; or among self-employed individuals. As a result, the data do not represent total U.S. employment. Non-S&E occupations include middle-skill and non-STEM occupations. Other S&E-related workers include actuaries, architects (except naval), postsecondary architecture teachers, and cartographers and photogrammetrists.
