**Modal ID:** 9440

**Table Number:** SK12-1

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Average score)

## Notes

The scale for NAEP mathematics assessment scores is 0–500 for students of all ages. From 1996 to 2022, data shown are for students allowed to use testing accommodations. Mathematics data for 17-year-old students are presented from only 2005, 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2019 because the mathematics framework was substantially revised in 2005, making prior assessment results not comparable with those in or after 2005. The mathematics assessment was not conducted in 2007, 2011, 2017, or 2022 for 17-year-old students.
