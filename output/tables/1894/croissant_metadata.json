Each publication is credited to a sector based on the institution type. Each collaborating institution is credited as co-authoring in this table when the listed authors come from different sectors. The publication is counted as one count in the sector (whole-counting). Publications can be authored by collaborators in multiple sectors, thus the sum of publications coauthored with various sectors can exceed the total. Publications from unknown U.S. sectors are not shown.",
