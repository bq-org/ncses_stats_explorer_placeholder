## Notes

Statistical difference is at the 0.05 level. The titles for NAICS 31-33, which are assigned the label of "Manufacturing" in the 2017 NAICS Manual, are modified here to provide more information for the reader. Information on the detailed retail industries in NAICS 44 and NAICS 45 is available at https://www.naics.com/what-is-naics-sector-44-45-full-description-and-statistics/. Information on the detailed Transportation and Warehousing industries in NAICS 48 and NAICS 49 is available at https://www.naics.com/naics-code-description/?code=48-49. These estimates are derived from companies with only a single location and may differ from the published innovation counts and estimates based on single- and multi-unit firms (Kindlon 2021). Limiting analysis to single-unit firms eliminates the potential headquartersâ€™ bias resulting from attributing innovation to the reporting location of multi-unit firms and reduces potential measurement error resulting from attributing company reports of innovation to all branch locations. The statistics allow inferences regarding the population of single-unit firms but do not allow inferences regarding the population of all firms.
