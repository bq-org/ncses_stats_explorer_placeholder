# Capital expenditures in the United States and for domestic R&D paid for and performed by the company, by type of expenditure and industry sector: 2018

**Modal ID:** 2361

**Table Number:** 6

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Millions of U.S. dollars)

## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Beginning in survey year 2018, companies that performed or funded less than $50,000 of R&D were excluded from tabulation. These companies in aggregate represented a very small share of total R&D expenditures in prior years. Had the companies under this threshold been included in the 2018 estimates, they would have contributed approximately $90 million to overall R&D expenditures. Estimates of aggregate capital expenditures would have been similarly affected. Industry classification was based on dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Excludes data for federally funded research and development centers.
