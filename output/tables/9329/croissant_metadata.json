Academic employment is limited to U.S. doctorate holders employed at 2- or 4-year colleges or universities, medical schools, and university research institutes, excluding those employed part time because they are students or retired. Full-time faculty include full professors, associate professors, and assistant professors. Research includes basic or applied research, development, or design. Degree fields use the traditional field of study aggregations from 2003 to 2015; from 2017, fine degree fields are aggregated at broad levels of the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics Taxonomy of Disciplines. Physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; life sciences include biological, agricultural, and environmental life and health sciences.",
