**Modal ID:** 1835

**Table Number:** S5a-17

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Fractional count, percent)

## Notes

Articles refer to publications from a selection of peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings in science and engineering fields from Scopus. Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a region, country, or economy on the basis of the institutional address(es) of the author(s) listed in the article. Articles are credited on a fractional-count basis (i.e., for articles from multiple countries, each country receives fractional credit on the basis of the proportion of its participating authors). Percentages may not add to 100% because of rounding. Data are not directly comparable to Science and Engineering Indicators 2018; see Technical Appendix section on data filters. See Table S5a-2 through Table S5a-16 for source data. See Table S5a-1 for regions, countries, and economies included in the EU.
