For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. These statistics include an adjustment to account for item nonresponse beginning in survey year 2016. This change has affected the comparability of these company count estimates with estimates published for years prior to 2016. These statistics do not include an adjustment to account for unit nonresponse. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States, regardless of whether the company performed or funded R&D.",
