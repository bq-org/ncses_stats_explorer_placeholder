  "notes": "Data are presented by calendar year. Taxonomy of Discipline (TOD) fields are used to classify articles. The TOD is a classification scheme developed by the National Science Foundation to suit its need for a unified scheme. Science-Metrix developed an alignment of its own classification scheme with the TOD and this alignment replaces the WebCASPAR classification that was used in the past to produce bibliometric data for the Science and Engineering Indicators reports. Journals are assigned to a unique TOD except for generalist journals, such as Science and Nature, for which articles are instead reclassified individually in TOD fields using an automated procedure based on machine-learning techniques. Articles are credited on a whole-count basis (i.e., each participating federal agency receives one count). The sum of the individual federal agencies may exceed the total across agencies as articles may have authors from multiple federal agencies.",
