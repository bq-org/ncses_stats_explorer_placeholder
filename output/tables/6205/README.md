# Top 50 commuting zones, by robust new-to-market innovation rates

**Modal ID:** 6205

**Table Number:** 4

**Type:** ST (Simple Tabular)

**Units:** (Share of innovating firms)

## Notes

"Yes" for regional shift indicates that the observed new-to-market innovation rate is statistically larger than the predicted new-to-market innovation rate at the 0.05 level. These estimates are derived from companies with only a single location and may differ from the published innovation counts and estimates based on single- and multi-unit firms (Kindlon 2021). Limiting analysis to single-unit firms eliminates the potential headquartersâ€™ bias resulting from attributing innovation to the reporting location of multi-unit firms and reduces potential measurement error resulting from attributing company reports of innovation to all branch locations. The statistics allow inferences regarding the population of single-unit firms but do not allow inferences regarding the population of all firms.
