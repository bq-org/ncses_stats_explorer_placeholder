# Observed and predicted any product innovation and new-to-market innovation rates, by state

**Modal ID:** 6204

**Table Number:** 3

**Type:** CH (Column Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Share of innovating firms)

## Notes

Shift refers to regional innovative shift in which + indicates that observed is statistically larger than predicted at the 0.05 level, and - indicates that observed is statistically smaller than predicted at the 0.05 level. These estimates are derived from companies with only a single location and may differ from the published innovation counts and estimates based on single- and multi-unit firms (Kindlon 2021). Limiting analysis to single-unit firms eliminates the potential headquartersâ€™ bias resulting from attributing innovation to the reporting location of multi-unit firms and reduces potential measurement error resulting from attributing company reports of innovation to all branch locations. The statistics allow inferences regarding the population of single-unit firms but do not allow inferences regarding the population of all firms.
