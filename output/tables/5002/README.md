## Notes

Article counts refer to publications from a selection of journals and conference proceedings in S&E from Scopus. Articles are classified by their year of publication and are assigned to a region, country, or economy on the basis of the institutional address(es) of the author(s) listed in the article. Articles are credited on a whole count basis (i.e., each collaborating region, country, or economy is credited with one count). Regions, countries, or economies that have contributed to less than 1% of all internationally coauthored articles in 2020 are omitted. Articles with multiple institutions are counts of articles with two or more institutional addresses. Articles with domestic institutions only are counts of articles with one or more institutional addresses all within a single region, country, or economy and include single-author articles institutional address. Articles with international institutions are counts of articles with institutional addresses from more than one region, country, or economy. The number of articles from the "With domestic institutions only" and "With international institutions" categories may not sum to the total article number. This is due to some coauthored publications having incomplete address information in the Scopus database. Those often cannot be reliably identified as international or domestic collaborations. They are, in turn, not included in either subcategory but are included in the number of articles in the “With multiple institutions” category and counted toward the total number of articles.
