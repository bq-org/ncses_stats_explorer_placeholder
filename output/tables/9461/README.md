# Research doctorate recipients, by historical broad field of doctorate and 2018 Carnegie Classification of doctorate institution: 2012&#8211;22

**Modal ID:** 9461

**Table Number:** 1-2

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Carnegie classification is based on the 2018 Carnegie Classifications: Doctoral universities - very high research (R1), Doctoral universities - high research (R2), Doctoral/ professional universities, and other universities, which includes all other Carnegie classifications (e.g., special focus institutions) and institutions without Carnegie classifications. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection; the historical fields were constructed using the SED-CIP code crosswalk in table A-6. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information, see the "Technical Notes" and the SED 2021 Taxonomy Changes Working Paper (available at https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses23200).
