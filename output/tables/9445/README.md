# Average and percentile scores of students in grade 4 on the TIMSS mathematics scale and percentile score gaps among participating advanced economies, by education system: 2019

**Modal ID:** 9445

**Table Number:** SK12-6

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Average and percentile score)

## Notes

TIMSS participants include countries, which are complete, independent political entities, and non-national entities (e.g., Hong Kong). Advanced economies are based on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) designation of advanced economies (Table A, pg. 132 in World Economic Outlook: Challenges to Steady Growth, 2018). IMF does not classify Russia as an advanced economy, but it is included in this analysis because it is a large economy with high levels of student achievement.
