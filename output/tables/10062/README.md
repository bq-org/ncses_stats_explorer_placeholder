The index of collaboration is calculated as follows: ICxy = (Cxy / Cx) / (Cy / Cw), where ICxy = index of collaboration between country x and country y, Cxy = number of papers coauthored between country x and country y in the relevant field, Cx = total number of international coauthorships by country x in the relevant field, Cy = total number of international coauthorships by country y in the relevant field, and Cw = total number of international coauthorships in the relevant field overall.
