## Notes

Data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) cover employed persons 16 years and older. Annual estimates are based on CPS monthly data. Postsecondary teachers of all fields are in non-STEM occupations. Military specific occupations are not included in the CPS data. Detail may not add to total because of rounding. This table will not match previously published tables exactly due to addition of sales engineers to the engineers aggregation. The Census Bureau does not include sales engineers in the engineers aggregation but the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics does.
