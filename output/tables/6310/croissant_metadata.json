For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. This table excludes data for federally funded R&D centers. Data for 2010\u201316 come from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics' (NCSES's) annual Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey, which covered all publicly or privately held companies with 5 or more employees. Data for 2017 and 2018 come from NCSES's annual Business Research and Development Survey, which covers all publicly or privately held companies with 10 or more employees. Data for 2019 come from NCSES's annual Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey, which also covers all publicly or privately held companies with 10 or more employees. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.",
