## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Country detail was not collected from companies reporting less than $1 million of R&D paid for by the company or reporting less than $1 million of R&D paid for by others. Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. This change has affected the comparability of these estimates with estimates published for years prior to 2018.
