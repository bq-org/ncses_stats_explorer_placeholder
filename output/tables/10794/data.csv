10794,r027,Department of Defense,Department of Defense,,,1,"Since volume 40, the Department of Defense (DOD) has reported research obligations and development obligations separately. Tables reporting obligations for research, by state and performer, and obligations for development, by state and performer, were specifically created for DOD. Circumstances specific to DOD are (1) DOD funds the preponderance of federal development and (2) DOD development funded at institutions of higher education is typically performed at university-affiliated nonacademic laboratories, which are separate from universities’ academic departments, where university research is typically performed."
10794,r028,,,,,1,"During the volume 44 survey cycle, the Director for Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) at DOD requested that the National Science Foundation (NSF) further clarify the true character of DOD’s R&D program, particularly as it compares with other federal agencies, by adding more detail to development obligations reported by DOD respondents. Specifically, DOD requested that NSF allow DOD agencies to report development obligations in two separate categories: advanced technology development and major systems development. An excerpt from a letter written by Robert V. Tuohy, Chief, Program Analysis and Integration at DDR&E, to John E. Jankowski, Program Director, Research and Development Statistics Program, Division of Science Resources Statistics, NSF, explains the reasoning behind the DDR&E request: ""The DOD’s R&D program is divided into two major pieces, Science and Technology (S&T) and Major Systems Development. The other federal agencies’ entire R&D programs are equivalent in nature to DOD’s S&T program, with the exception of the Department of Energy and possibly the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Comparing those other agency programs to DOD’s program, including the development of weapons systems such as F-22 Fighter and the New Attack Submarine, is misleading."""
10794,r029,,,,,1,"Not all DOD agencies with development obligations are able to categorize them according to the advanced technology and major systems development breakdown. Therefore, in the volume 46 (FYs 1996–98) survey cycle, total DOD development does not equal the sum of total DOD advanced technology development and total DOD major systems development."
10794,r030,,,,,1,"Beginning with volume 54 (FYs 2004–06), DOD now requires its reporting agencies to adhere to DOD control numbers when providing data to the Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development."

Consequently, DOD began reporting additional classified R&D not previously reported by its subagencies."
10794,r032,,,,,1,"Starting with volume 62 (FYs 2012–14), an ""undistributed"" category was added to the geographic location tables for DOD obligations for which the location of performance is not reported. It includes DOD obligations for industry R&D that were included in individual state totals prior to FY 2012 and DOD obligations for other performers that were not reported prior to FY 2011. This change was applied retroactively to FY 2011 data."
10794,r033,,,,,1,"Beginning with FY 2016, the totals reported for development outlays represent a refinement to this category by more narrowly defining it to be “experimental development.” Most notably, totals for development do not include the DOD Budget Activity 7 (Operational System Development) outlays. Those funds, previously included in DOD’s development outlay totals, support the development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year. Therefore, the data are not directly comparable with totals reported in previous years."
10794,r034,,,,,1,"As of volume 66 (FYs 2016–17), the definition of major systems development was changed to represent DOD Budget Activities 4 through 6 instead of Budget Activities 4 through 7."
