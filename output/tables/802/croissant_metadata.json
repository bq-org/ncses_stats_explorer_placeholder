Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded R&D. Most statistics for years prior to 2015 have been revised since originally published. Revised statistics include adjustments based on information obtained after the original statistics were prepared. For survey year 2008, industry classification was based on the 2002 NAICS. For survey years 2009\u201313, industry classification was based on the 2007 NAICS.",
