  "notes": "Because of rounding, detail may not add to total. Only those agencies and subdivisions that had obligations in variables represented by this table appear in the table. Beginning with FY 2016, the totals reported for development obligations represent a refinement to this category by more narrowly defining it to be \"experimental development.\" Most notably, totals for development do not include the Department of Defense (DOD) Budget Activity 7 (Operational Systems Development) obligations. Those funds, previously included in DOD's development obligation totals, support the development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year. Therefore, the data are not directly comparable with totals reported in previous years. FY 2020 preliminary data do not include obligations from supplemental COVID-19 related appropriations (e.g., Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security [CARES] Act). See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table.",
