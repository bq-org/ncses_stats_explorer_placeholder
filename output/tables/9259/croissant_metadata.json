Labor force is defined as those employed (E) plus those unemployed and seeking work (U). Unemployed includes individuals who were not working during the survey reference week but had been seeking work in the prior 4 weeks or who were on layoff from their job. Population (P) is defined as all science, engineering, or health doctorate holders under age 76, residing in the United States during the week of 1 February 2021, who earned doctorates from U.S. institutions. Unemployment rate (UR) = U / (E + U). Labor force participation rate (LFR) = (E + U) / P. Residence location is based on reported living location on 1 February 2021.",
