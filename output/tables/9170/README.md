# Transition probabilities for the 2015 to 2017 job satisfaction LTA model with covariates for employment sector by 2015 job satisfaction class

**Modal ID:** 9170

**Table Number:** 8

**Type:** CH (Column Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Probability)

## Notes

Transition probabilities in this table represent the probability of belonging to a specific job satisfaction class at the 2017 SDR cycle (column) conditional on belonging to a specific employment sector at the 2015 SDR cycle (row), grouped by 2015 job satisfaction class. The 2015 to 2017 transition probabilities for the entire sample from the job satisfaction LTA in table 5 are provided for reference and highlighted in gray. Class stability parameters are in bold. Differences reaching the level of a small effect or larger are highlighted in blue. Rows may not sum to 1.000 due to rounding.
