American Indian or Alaska Native doctorate recipients with unknown or refused citizenship status are counted as U.S. citizens and thus are included. Data in this table refer to research doctorates only and differ from doctoral degree data in this report that are based on the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Completions Survey. The greatest differences are in psychology, education, and medical or other health sciences, which are fields with many professional doctorates.",
