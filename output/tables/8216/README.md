# Labor force participation rate among U.S. residing doctoral scientists and engineers, by occupation: 2021

**Modal ID:** 8216

**Table Number:** 32-3

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Percent and SE)

## Notes

Percentage rounded to the nearest 0.1%, standard error of the unrounded percentage (based on unrounded counts), rounded up to the nearest multiple of 0.05%. Labor force is defined as those employed (E) plus those unemployed and seeking work (U). Unemployed includes individuals who were not working during the survey reference week but had been seeking work in the prior 4 weeks or who were on layoff from their job. Population (P) is defined as all S&E doctorate holders less than 76 years of age, who were residing in the United States during the week of 1 February 2021, and who earned doctorates from U.S. institutions. Labor force participation rate (RLF) = (E + U) / P. If respondent was not employed during survey reference period, occupation when last employed was reported. Individuals who reported never having worked but who were still in the labor force during the reference week are included in overall (All occupations) rate calculation but are excluded from computing the rates by occupation. Residence location is based on reported living location on 1 February 2021.
