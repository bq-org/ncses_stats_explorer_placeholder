  "notes": "Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. This change has affected the comparability of these estimates with estimates published for years prior to 2018. For a given estimate in this table, if the conditions are satisfied for both the i and e flags, the e flag is assigned, because the imputation rate may be found in the corresponding table of imputation rates. A CBSA is a U.S. geographic area that consists of one or more counties (or equivalents) anchored by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties that are socioeconomically tied to the urban center by commuting. CBSAs are defined by the Office of Management and Budget in the Executive Office of the President. An estimate range may be displayed in place of a single estimate to avoid disclosing operations of individual companies.",
