## Notes

Detail within a select location may not add to total because of rounding.Â Sum of locations does not equal all locations due to the undistributed portion not being published. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Beginning in survey year 2018, statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D and also performed foreign R&D and are not comparable with estimates published for years prior to 2018.
