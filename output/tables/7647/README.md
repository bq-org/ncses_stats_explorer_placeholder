**Modal ID:** 7647

**Table Number:** A-2

**Type:** RH (Row Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Field)

## Notes

Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and the new broad, major, and detailed fields are in tables reporting only the most recent data year. Therefore, the field of doctorate data in 2021 may not be comparable to prior years. See table A-1 for a full list of SED-CIP codes in the new field taxonomy and table A-3 for the SED-CIP code crosswalk to the historical field taxonomy.
