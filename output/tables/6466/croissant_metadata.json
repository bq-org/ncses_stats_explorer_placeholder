Agencies were requested to report their FY 2020 obligations for COVID-19 related R&D that were from their agency's initial appropriations as well as from any stimulus funds received from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act plus any other pandemic-related supplemental appropriations. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority accounted for 66% of all COVID-19 research; a substantial portion of these funds include transfers to other agencies for COVID-19 R&D in support of Operation Warp Speed. See technical table A-2 for additional notes associated with the agencies listed in this table.",
