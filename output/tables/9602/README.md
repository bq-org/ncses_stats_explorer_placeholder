# Research doctorate recipients who earned a bachelor's degree related to doctorate, by sex, citizenship status, ethnicity, race, and broad field of doctorate: 2022

**Modal ID:** 9602

**Table Number:** 5-2

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Percent)

## Notes

Percentages based on total number of doctorate recipients. Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100. A bachelor's and doctoral degree are considered to be in the same field if doctorate recipient's first or most recent bachelor's degree is in the same broad field as their doctoral degree. Beginning in 2021, a modified version of the 2020 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes was used in the survey data collection, and new broad, major, and detailed fields are used in tables reporting data from 2021 to the present; see the field list in table A-4. Therefore, the field of doctorate data prior to 2021 may not be comparable to subsequent years. For more information, see the "Technical Notes" and the SED 2021 Taxonomy Changes Working Paper (available at https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses23200).
