  "notes": "Institutional-yield ratio is the number of S&E doctorate recipients per 100 bachelor's degrees awarded in all fields 9 years earlier. Only institutions from which 50 or more baccalaureate recipients received S&E doctorate degrees between 2010 and 2020 were included in the analysis. Institutions are ranked on unrounded ratios. Institutions with the same number of doctorate recipients are listed alphabetically. R1: doctoral universities are institutions with very high research activity and R2: doctoral universities are institutions with high research activity.",
