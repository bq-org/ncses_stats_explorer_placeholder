Item nonresponse in the Survey of Earned Doctorates affects citizenship status at graduation, country of origin, and expected post-graduation residency plans. All early career S&E doctorate holders include those with missing and nonmissing information. Weighted population counts rounded to the nearest 50. Detail may not add to total because of missing data due to item nonresponse.",
