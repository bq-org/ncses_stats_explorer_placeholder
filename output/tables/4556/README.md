**Modal ID:** 4556

**Table Number:** 2

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number)

## Notes

Early career S&E doctorate holders are those who graduated in 2006–15. Imputed country of origin is country of citizenship at graduation for those reporting this information and it is birthplace for those not reporting country of citizenship. Item nonresponse in the Survey of Earned Doctorates affects citizenship status at graduation, country of origin, and expected post-graduation residency plans. All early career S&E doctorate holders include those with missing and nonmissing information. Weighted population counts rounded to the nearest 50. Detail may not add to total because of missing data due to item nonresponse.
