Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded R&D. In all other tables, R&D costs of foreign-company subsidiaries of U.S. companies are included in company-funded U.S. domestic R&D totals. Only in this table are such R&D costs classified as being part of R&D paid for by sources located outside of the United States.
