# Companies in the target population and selected for the sample, by industry: 2016

**Modal ID:** 1471

**Table Number:** A-1

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Number of companies)

## Notes

Certainties were companies with a probability of selection of one because they were in an industry where all companies were included in the sample or they had a payroll that was in the top 100 in their state. Noncertainties are companies with a probability of selection of less than 1. Companies that were missing or had an incomplete NAICS code at the time of sampling were assigned to an "unclassified" industry category temporarily. If an unclassified company reported R&D expenditures, its primary industrial activity was investigated, and a NAICS code was assigned during statistical processing. The total sample size reflects the time between sample selection and survey mailout; that is, the sample was updated before actual mailout took place.
