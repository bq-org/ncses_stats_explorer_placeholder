## Notes

Statistics are representative of companies in the United States that were eligible to receive Form BRDI-1 and performed or funded R&D. These statistics are not comparable to estimates prior to 2012 as those estimates are representative of all companies in the United States. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned.
