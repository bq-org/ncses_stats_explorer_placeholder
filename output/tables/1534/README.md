# Average TIMSS mathematics scores of students in grade 8 and percentage of students in the highest and lowest percentiles among participating developed economies, by education system: 2015

**Modal ID:** 1534

**Table Number:** 1-4

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Average score and percent)

## Notes

Education systems are listed in descending order by the percentage of students scoring at or above the 90th percentile. TIMSS participants include both countries, which are complete, independent political entities, and non-national entities (e.g., Hong Kong). Developed economies are based on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) designation of advanced economies (Table A, pg. 132 in World Economic Outlook: Challenges to Steady Growth, 2018). IMF classifies Russia as a developing economy, but it is included in this analysis because it is a large economy with high levels of student achievement.
