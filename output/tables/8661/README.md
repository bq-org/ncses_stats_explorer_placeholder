# U.S. capital expenditures by business R&D performers, total and for domestic R&D, by selected industry and company size: 2020

**Modal ID:** 8661

**Table Number:** 1

**Type:** MH (Matrix Hierarchical)

**Units:** (Millions of U.S. dollars and percent)

## Notes

Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Industry classification is based on the dominant business code for domestic R&D performance, where available. For companies that did not report business codes, the classification used for sampling was assigned. Statistics are representative of companies located in the United States that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D and are not comparable with estimates published for years prior to 2018. The "undistributed" column shown in prior years is no longer necessary because of processing improvements implemented beginning in 2015.
