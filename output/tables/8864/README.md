## Notes

Data for nonprofit organizations exclude nonprofit universities and colleges and federally funded research and development centers administered by nonprofit organizations. Organizations are assigned to states based on their mailing address. Rankings are based on point estimates and do not consider the variance of the survey sample.Data for higher education institutions have not been adjusted to eliminate the double counting of funds passed through from an academic institution to subrecipients (other academic institutions, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and others). At the national level, funds passed through to such subrecipients accounted for 8% of total R&D expenditures reported by higher education institutions in FY 2020.
